:class:`SimulationService` is the ONE GUI-agnostic backend API both the
future GUI (Phase 1+) and a headless/batch CLI call to go from a
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.Scenario` to a
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.engine.results.ResultSet`. It wraps Basilisk's
``SimulationBaseClass``/task-process architecture directly -- there is no
other layer between this class and Basilisk.

Phase 0 scope
-------------
Deliberately narrow, matching exactly what the two-body analytical
validation scenario (``scenarios/two_body_validation.json``,
``tests/test_two_body_validation.py``) needs and nothing more:

* Central-body gravity, point-mass (``gravity.central_body_degree == 0``)
  or spherical harmonics (> 0, Earth-only for now -- GGM03S, the same
  gravity file already used in ``../missionAnalysis``), PLUS third-body
  point-mass perturbers (``gravity.third_body_perturbers``): both the
  central body and every perturber are created via
  ``gravBodyFactory.createBodies()`` and then ``addBodiesTo(sc_object)``
  attaches ALL of them as gravitational contributors to each spacecraft
  -- this is the exact same mechanism (verified, not assumed: see
  ``../missionAnalysis/run_constellation_mission.py``'s own comment on
  ``addBodiesTo()``) that already gives the Moon and Sun as automatic
  third-body perturbers there, with no extra per-body wiring needed
  beyond creating them. An earlier version of this docstring claimed
  third-body perturbers were schema-only and not actually wired up here;
  that was wrong (this service already adds them) and has been corrected.
* One or more spacecraft, each from a classical-elements, Cartesian, or
  TLE initial condition (:class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.OrbitIC`).
* Orbital dynamics only -- attitude integrates (Basilisk always integrates
  it), but nothing controls or reads it yet.
* A single dynamics task, propagated for ``sim_settings.duration_days``.

Explicitly NOT wired up yet in Phase 0 (validated by the schema and
carried through save/load starting now, so the schema doesn't need to
change shape later, but silently ignored by this service until the phase
that implements it): drag, SRP, space weather. The Phase 1 GUI (see
``gui/``) deliberately does not expose editors for these either, for the
same reason: a control that looks like it configures simulated behavior
but silently doesn't is worse than not offering it yet. (Phase 4, below,
is where this gap closes: ``SpacecraftConfig.enable_drag``/``enable_srp``
are wired up there via ``engine/spaceweather.py``'s resolver -> MSIS or
exponential atmosphere (``SpaceWeatherConfig.atmosphere_model`` -- a later
addition; see that schema class's own docstring) -> ``dragDynamicEffector``/
``radiationPressure``.)

Phase 2 scope
-------------
Adds attitude sensors, actuators, FSW pointing/control modes, and Vizard
integration on top of Phase 0's propagation-only baseline. All the actual
guidance/control/actuation chain construction lives in ``engine/fsw.py``
(kept separate so this file stays orchestration-only) -- see that module's
docstring for the exact Basilisk module each ``fsw_mode``/sensor kind/
actuator kind maps to, and for every scoping decision made along the way
(e.g. why ``locationPointing``'s ``target_body`` option and the
``"thruster"``/``"magnetic_torque_rod"`` actuator kinds are schema-valid
but not built here). ``engine/vizard.py`` covers the Vizard integration,
triggered via :class:`SimulationService`'s own ``vizard_request`` constructor
parameter (an ``engine.vizard.VizardRequest``).

Phase 3 scope
-------------
Adds ground-station ACCESS analysis and Monte Carlo batch execution, per
the roadmap's "Phase 3: Monte Carlo + access analysis + packaging".

* Ground-station access: every :class:`schema.scenario.GroundStationConfig`
  now gets a ``groundLocation.GroundLocation`` (used both as a
  ``locationPointing`` target, per Phase 2, and for access analysis), and
  once every spacecraft is built, :func:`engine.fsw.add_access_analysis`
  is called once per station against the FULL spacecraft list -- every
  station sees every spacecraft, which is the standard access-analysis
  question ("when can station X see spacecraft Y"), not just the ones a
  station happens to be a pointing target for. :meth:`run` records
  ``hasAccess``/``slantRange``/``elevation``/``azimuth`` per
  (station, spacecraft) pair.
* Monte Carlo: lives in ``engine/monte_carlo.py``, not here --
  :meth:`build` grew an ``initialize`` parameter (default ``True``)
  specifically so that module can build a sim, apply
  ``Basilisk.utilities.MonteCarlo`` dispersions to it, and only THEN call
  ``InitializeSimulation()``/``ConfigureStopTime()`` itself (calling
  ``InitializeSimulation()`` before dispersions are applied would `Reset()`
  every module against the UN-dispersed nominal values, silently
  defeating the dispersion). See that module's docstring for the full
  design and its own scoping notes (e.g. why Cartesian position/velocity
  dispersion is deliberately not offered).

Packaging is covered in ``packaging/`` (build scripts, installer, desktop
entry) and ``SpaceMissionStudio/README.md``'s packaging section, not in this
module -- there's no runtime code for it.

Verification status
--------------------
Requires a Basilisk build. A from-source build inside this project's
sandbox was attempted early on and failed (blocked Conan Center network
access); later, ``pip install "bsk[all]"`` (Basilisk's own published PyPI
package) turned out to work in that same sandbox -- see
``SpaceMissionStudio/README.md``'s "Getting started" section for the working
install path this project actually verified.

Against that real build, ``build()`` was confirmed to run correctly
through gravity/SPICE-interface construction, spacecraft assembly (mass,
inertia, orbit IC, integrator selection), and attitude/sensor/actuator/
ground-station wiring -- it fails only at the SPICE kernel DOWNLOAD step
inside ``engine.kernels``, because that sandbox's network egress to NAIF's
kernel host was blocked (see ``kernels.py``'s own verification note); this
is an environment limitation, not a code path that was skipped. A real
bug was found and fixed this way in ``engine/time_system.py`` (a bare
``import pyswice`` that doesn't match the published package's module
layout) -- see that module's own docstring. Every Basilisk module/class
this file and ``engine/fsw.py``/``vizard.py``/``monte_carlo.py`` import
was individually confirmed to exist under the expected name in that real
build. Full end-to-end execution (a run that gets PAST kernel loading) was
NOT achieved in this sandbox, for the network reason above -- that
remains to be exercised on a machine with ordinary internet access, ideally
starting with ``tests/test_two_body_validation.py``.

The calling conventions in this file also mirror the same verified API
calls already exercised (and long since run against a real Basilisk
build) in ``../missionAnalysis/run_constellation_mission.py`` earlier in
this project (``gravBodyFactory``, ``spacecraft.Spacecraft``,
``svIntegrators``, ``orbitalMotion``). The integrator class lookup (see
``_INTEGRATORS`` below) was confirmed both by directly listing
``src/simulation/dynamics/Integrators/`` in this checkout and, now, by
import against a real (if newer/PyPI-sourced) Basilisk build -- note that
build also exposes ``svIntegratorRK4``, which this checkout's own source
does not; ``_INTEGRATORS`` intentionally still doesn't offer it, since
this schema targets what THIS checkout ships, not whatever a given
installed version happens to add.

    a :class:`SimulationServiceError` with an actual explanation, instead
    of letting Basilisk's own bare exception message (e.g. ``std::bad_alloc``
    or ``basic_string::_M_create``) be the only thing the user ever sees.

    Real crash, root-caused by reading Basilisk's own C++ source after a
    user hit this twice on the same template scenario: a Python exception
    escaping a SWIG director-overridden ``UpdateState()`` is NOT undefined
    behavior in this Basilisk version, contrary to what an earlier revision
    of this comment (and ``engine.orbit_maintenance``'s matching one)
    assumed -- ``SimThreadExecution``'s worker-thread loop
    (``architecture/system_model/sim_model.cpp``) wraps every tick in
    ``catch (...) { threadException = std::current_exception(); }`` and
    the parent thread re-throws it cleanly via ``std::rethrow_exception``,
    which SWIG surfaces to Python as an ordinary, catchable ``RuntimeError``
    -- exactly what reached here.

    The ACTUAL mechanism (also confirmed by reading
    ``simulation/dynamics/_GeneralModuleFiles/svIntegratorAdaptiveRungeKutta.h``):
    once the integrated state goes non-finite (NaN/inf) partway through a
    dynamics tick, ``computeMaxRelativeError()`` returns NaN; the
    step-acceptance check ``maxRelError <= 1.`` is then always false (every
    comparison against NaN is false), so ``integrate()``'s ``while (time <
    startingTime + desiredTimeStep)`` loop never advances `time` and never
    exits -- ``std::min``/``std::max`` on a NaN argument in that same
    function also always return the NaN side, so the "shrink the step and
    retry" fallback can't recover either. The result is a genuine infinite
    loop, re-evaluating the (still-NaN) state and allocating fresh
    ``Eigen`` temporaries every iteration, until the process's heap is
    exhausted -- which is why this surfaces as ``std::bad_alloc`` (a clean
    allocation failure) on some runs and heap corruption
    (``basic_string::_M_create``, some unrelated allocation elsewhere
    tripping over an already-exhausted/corrupted heap) on others: same
    root cause, whichever allocation happens to be the one that finally
    fails.

    This can't be prevented from Python -- it happens entirely inside one
    C++ call with no hook back into Basilisk's own EOM/integrator -- so
    the best this service can do is turn the resulting crash into a clear,
    actionable message instead of a bare native exception string.

        is called after each one, so a caller (SpaceMissionStudio's GUI) can
        redraw a plot while the run is still in flight instead of only
        once it finishes.

        This relies on a documented, supported Basilisk pattern: repeated
        ``ConfigureStopTime()``/``ExecuteSimulation()`` pairs. ``ExecuteSimulation()``
        always resumes from wherever ``TotalSim.NextTaskTime`` currently
        is (see ``SimulationBaseClass.ExecuteSimulation()``'s
        ``CheckStopCondition()`` loop) rather than restarting from t=0, so
        calling it again with a larger stop time just continues the same
        run. Recorders keep accumulating samples across chunks exactly as
        they would across one uninterrupted call, so each chunk's
        :meth:`_extract_results` is simply "whatever has been logged so
        far" -- not a separate bookkeeping path from :meth:`run`. Which
        series exist is decided once by ``self.scenario``/:meth:`build`,
        never by how much data has been recorded yet, so the set of series
        names is identical across every ``on_progress`` call (including
        the first) and matches :meth:`run`'s -- only the amount of data in
        each grows.

        Args:
            on_progress: called after each chunk with
                ``(partial_result, fraction_complete)``, ``fraction_complete``
                in ``[0, 1]`` (exactly ``1.0`` on the final call). Any
                exception it raises propagates out of ``run_live`` and
                aborts the run, same as an exception anywhere else in the
                simulation would.
            live_step_s: how much sim time to advance per chunk/callback
                [s]. Defaults to
                ``duration_days * 86400 / _LIVE_DEFAULT_FRAMES`` (about
                ``_LIVE_DEFAULT_FRAMES`` callbacks over the whole run),
                clamped to never be smaller than one dynamics tick
                (``sim_settings.dynamics_task_rate_s``) -- ``ExecuteSimulation()``
                has real per-call overhead, so a sub-tick step would only
                add Python-loop cost with no extra simulated time to show
                for it.
            should_cancel: checked after every chunk (after ``on_progress``
                runs); if it returns ``True``, raises
                :class:`SimulationCancelled` (carrying that chunk's
                ``ResultSet``) instead of continuing to the next one --
                the "abort a running simulation" GUI feature. There is no
                way to interrupt ``ExecuteSimulation()`` itself mid-chunk
                (Basilisk's own C++ loop, no Python-level hook into it),
                so cancellation always takes effect at the next chunk
                boundary, not instantly -- this is the same reason
                ``live_step_s`` matters for responsiveness here as it
                already does for plot-update smoothness. ``None`` (the
                default) means never cancel, matching every existing
