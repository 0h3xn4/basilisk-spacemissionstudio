Phasing-formation generator: turns an existing "chief" spacecraft's orbit
plus a desired chief -> follower offset in the RADIAL/TRANSVERSE/NORMAL
(Hill) frame at epoch into a new follower :class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.scenario.SpacecraftConfig`
with ``phasing_keeping`` (and the ``station_keeping`` it requires)
pre-wired -- the initial-geometry counterpart to
``engine.constellation``'s Walker generator, built for exactly the
two-satellite "chief holds station, follower holds formation" case
``05_formation_flying_phasing.json`` demonstrates by hand ("Generate
phasing formation..." in the GUI).

Unlike ``engine.constellation`` (deliberately Basilisk-free -- see that
module's docstring: a Walker pattern is naturally expressed directly in
classical elements, no coordinate transform needed), this module uses
Basilisk's own ``Basilisk.utilities.orbitalMotion`` functions
(``elem2rv``/``hill2rv``/``rv2elem``/``M2E``/``E2f``) -- never a
hand-rolled equivalent -- plus ``Basilisk.utilities.simIncludeGravBody``
for a real ``mu``/``radEquator`` (the same body-constants source
``engine.service`` itself uses, rather than a second hardcoded copy like
``engine.constellation``'s own ``CENTRAL_BODY_EQUATORIAL_RADIUS_KM``).
Needs a real Basilisk build; gated ``requires_basilisk`` in tests, same
tier as ``engine.service``/``engine.orbit_maintenance`` -- the GUI action
that calls this catches ``ImportError`` and reports it the same way every
other Basilisk-needing GUI action already does (see ``gui.run_worker``).

The chief's orbit must already be ``type == "classical_elements"`` --
same requirement ``engine.service`` itself enforces for any
``phasing_keeping.chief_spacecraft`` (it needs the chief's semi-major
axis directly; see that module's matching check), surfaced here as a
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.scenario.ScenarioValidationError` up front
rather than left to fail later inside a run.

**Along-track (T) is NOT placed via a single ``hill2rv`` call from the
chief's state, and this is deliberate, not an oversight** -- a real,
100%-reproducible bug, found from an actual user's report (a real
Vizard run showing a requested 500 km separation reading as ~0 km at
generation time): ``orbitalMotion.rv2elem()`` decomposing a
``hill2rv``-perturbed near-circular state puts essentially the ENTIRE
along-track angle into ``omega`` (argument of periapsis), not ``f`` (true
anomaly) -- confirmed directly, independent of offset size (1 km through
500 km all came back with ``f`` within floating-point noise of the
CHIEF's own ``f``). ``engine.orbit_maintenance.PhasingKeepingController``
only ever reads ``f``/mean-anomaly (never ``omega``) to measure
along-track separation, so a follower placed that way was invisible to
it: the controller believed it was already on target and never fired.
Fixed by placing T as a DIRECT mean-anomaly shift on the chief's own
``(a, e, i, Omega, omega)`` (Kepler's equation, via ``M2E``/``E2f``,
same arc-length convention ``engine.orbit_maintenance.SeparationSchedule``
itself uses) -- this is exactly what a real, propagated Basilisk state
started this way reports back through the SAME ``rv2elem`` call
``PhasingKeepingController`` makes every tick, confirmed numerically
(500 km requested reads back as exactly 500.000 km).

R/N (radial/cross-track) are layered on AFTERWARD via ``hill2rv``, on
top of that already-correct T placement -- see
:func:`generate_phasing_follower`'s own docstring for why, and for how
much each one, individually, still perturbs the along-track reading
(R much more than N).

IMPORTANT LIMITATION, stated here and surfaced in the GUI dialog itself:
:class:`engine.orbit_maintenance.PhasingKeepingController` only closes
the loop on the ALONG-TRACK (transverse) component of chief/follower
separation (see that class's own docstring) -- it has no radial or
cross-track control authority at all. Only T feeds
``phasing_keeping.target_separation_km`` as the actively-maintained
target; any radial/cross-track offset requested is a STARTING geometry
only and will drift over the run exactly as any other uncontrolled
orbital difference would (this also means the follower's resulting
semi-major-axis/inclination/RAAN will differ slightly from the chief's
own whenever a nonzero radial/cross-track offset is requested -- expected
and physically correct, not a bug: a real offset in those axes implies a
genuinely different, if nearby, orbital plane/altitude, exactly the same
way ``05_formation_flying_phasing.json``'s own hand-written
along-track-only offset already relies on the along-track control law
tolerating a small, otherwise-uncontrolled orbital mismatch).
