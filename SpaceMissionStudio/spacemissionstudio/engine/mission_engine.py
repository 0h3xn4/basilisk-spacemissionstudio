Phase 6 (Mission Sequence), part 2: :class:`MissionEngine` walks a
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.Scenario`'s ``mission_sequence`` (built by
``schema/command.py``, Phase 6 part 1) against a real
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.engine.service.SimulationService`, executing each
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.command.Command` in order.

Every Basilisk call sequence below is verified directly against this
checkout's own source or an actually-running official example, not
written from memory:

* Repeated ``ConfigureStopTime()``/``ExecuteSimulation()`` pairs, with
  ``ConfigureStopTime()`` taking an ABSOLUTE cumulative simulation time
  (not a delta) -- ``examples/scenarioOrbitManeuver.py``'s own comment:
  "the total simulation time must be provided, not just the next
  incremental simulation time". ``ExecuteSimulation()`` always resumes
  from ``TotalSim.NextTaskTime``/``CurrentNanos`` rather than restarting
  (see ``SimulationBaseClass.ExecuteSimulation()``'s ``CheckStopCondition()``
  loop) -- already exercised by this project's own, already-passing
  ``engine.service.SimulationService.run_live()`` and
  ``tests/test_service_run_live.py``.
* Impulsive maneuvers: ``scObject.dynManager.getStateObject(scObject.hub.nameOfHubPosition
  /nameOfHubVelocity)`` fetched once, ``simHelpers.EigenVector3d2np(velRef.getState())``
  to read the current velocity as a numpy array, plain numpy arithmetic to
  compute the new velocity, ``velRef.setState(newVelocityNumpyArray)`` to
  apply it -- ``setState()`` accepts a raw numpy array directly (SWIG's
  own typemap converts it), no explicit Eigen-conversion call needed on
  the way in -- all copied from ``examples/scenarioOrbitManeuver.py``'s
  own two maneuver applications, not guessed.
* Orbital-event stop conditions (periapsis/apoapsis): Basilisk's own
  native event mechanism, ``SimBaseClass.createNewEvent(eventName,
  eventRate, eventActive, conditionFunction=..., terminal=True)`` --
  copied from ``examples/scenarioDragDeorbit.py``'s own
  "Event to terminate the simulation" block (its ``conditionFunction``
  reads the spacecraft's OWN output message directly via
  ``scStateOutMsg.read()``, not a subscribed reader -- also copied from
  there). ``ExecuteSimulation()`` checks every active event on every task
  tick where ``eventRate`` divides evenly (see
  ``EventHandlerClass.shouldBeChecked()``/``ExecuteSimulation()``'s own
  event-checking loop in ``SimulationBaseClass.py``) and sets
  ``scSim.terminate = True`` when a ``terminal=True`` event fires,
  breaking ``ExecuteSimulation()``'s loop early -- no extra plumbing
  needed beyond creating the event before the ``ExecuteSimulation()``
  call that should be interrupted by it. ``ExecuteSimulation()`` itself
  then unconditionally resets ``scSim.terminate`` back to ``False`` as
  its own very last statement before returning -- confirmed directly
  against source (and by a live diagnostic once this was actually run),
  so a caller can never tell whether a terminal event fired by reading
  that flag afterward; :meth:`MissionEngine._run_propagate_event` checks
  the fired event's own ``occurCounter`` instead.

``assignment``/``report``/``if``/``while``/``script_block`` have no
Basilisk-API precedent to verify against -- they are this project's own
design (see each one's own docstring below for the reasoning), scoped as
narrowly as the Phase 6 part 1 schema module's own docstring describes.
