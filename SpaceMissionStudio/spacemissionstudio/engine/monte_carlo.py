Phase 3: Monte Carlo batch execution, wrapping the real, already-native
``Basilisk.utilities.MonteCarlo`` framework (``Controller``,
``Dispersions``, ``RetentionPolicy``) -- this module does not reimplement
any dispersion math or batch-execution logic; it only translates
:class:`schema.scenario.MonteCarloConfig`/``DispersionConfig`` into calls
against that framework, matching the pattern already `.md` documented in
``src/utilities/MonteCarlo/README.md`` and exercised end-to-end in
``examples/scenarioMonteCarloAttRW.py``.

Why ``SimulationService.build(initialize=False)``
---------------------------------------------------
``Controller`` calls, per run: creation function (no args, returns a
``SimBaseClass``) -> apply dispersions (mutating attributes directly on
that returned sim object, via dotted/indexed/zero-arg-method path strings
-- see ``Controller.SimulationExecutor.getNestedAttr``/``setNestedAttr``)
-> configure function (optional) -> execution function. Basilisk's
``InitializeSimulation()`` calls ``Reset()`` on every module using
whatever attribute values are set AT THAT MOMENT -- if it already ran
(which ``SimulationService.build()`` always used to do, Phase 0 through
Phase 2), a dispersion applied afterward would silently have no effect,
since Reset() already latched in the un-dispersed nominal values. So the
creation function here calls ``service.build(initialize=False)`` and the
execution function finishes the job (``InitializeSimulation()``,
``ConfigureStopTime()``, ``ExecuteSimulation()``) AFTER the Controller has
applied every dispersion.

A ``dry_mass_kg`` dispersion writes directly to ``hub.mHub`` (see
``_QUANTITY_PATHS`` below), which survives ``Reset()`` fine (no module's
``Reset()`` touches ``hub.mHub``) -- but a real bug, found by audit and
fixed in ``engine.orbit_maintenance``, used to silently UNDO it on the
first tick for any spacecraft with ``station_keeping``/``constant_thrust``
configured: those controllers used to recompute ``hub.mHub`` from their
own construction-time-captured, undispersed ``dry_mass_kg`` every tick,
discarding whatever this dispersion had just set. See
``engine.orbit_maintenance``'s "Shared mass bookkeeping" docstring note --
those controllers now read ``hub.mHub`` back and only subtract what they
themselves burn, so a dispersion applied here is preserved correctly.

A second, DIFFERENT ``dry_mass_kg`` bug (also found by audit, also fixed):
Basilisk's dispersion classes write their generated value ABSOLUTELY to
the target path, with no way to add anything on top -- but
``schema.scenario.SpacecraftConfig.dry_mass_kg`` is documented as the
mass WITHOUT station-keeping/constant-thrust propellant, while
``hub.mHub`` (this dispersion's actual target) is ``dry_mass_kg +
propellant`` (see ``service.py``'s own ``initial_mass_kg`` computation).
Applying a plain ``UniformDispersion``/``NormalDispersion`` straight to
``hub.mHub`` under the name "dry_mass_kg" would therefore silently
disperse the TOTAL mass under that name for any spacecraft with
``station_keeping``/``constant_thrust`` configured -- bounds the user
picked to disperse just the dry mass would actually disperse dry mass +
propellant, quietly shrinking the effective dry-mass spread by exactly
the propellant amount. Fixed with
:class:`_DryMassPlusPropellantUniformDispersion`/
:class:`_DryMassPlusPropellantNormalDispersion`, which add that
spacecraft's configured propellant back on top of the generated
dry-mass value before it's written to ``hub.mHub``.

Dispersion path resolution
---------------------------
Basilisk's dispersion path strings resolve via attribute access, integer
indexing, and zero-argument method calls ONLY -- no string-keyed lookups
(confirmed by reading ``Controller._parseAttributePath``/``_resolvePathPart``
directly: a path segment is either ``.name``, ``[int]``, or ``name()``).
Since a scenario can have several spacecraft, and there is no
string-keyed way to reach "the sc_object for spacecraft named X" from the
sim object, the creation function attaches one dynamically-named,
zero-argument accessor method per spacecraft directly onto the returned
sim object (``sim.get_spacecraft_<sanitized name>()`` -> that spacecraft's
``spacecraft.Spacecraft`` instance) -- a dispersion path like
``"get_spacecraft_sat_1().hub.mHub"`` then resolves exactly per the rules
above. This is not a Basilisk API; it is this module's own bridge, built
entirely from the documented, verified path-resolution rules.

Retained data
-------------
V1 scope: every run retains each spacecraft's position/velocity
(``r_BN_N``/``v_BN_N`` off its ``scStateOutMsg`` recorder, via
``sim.msgRecList`` + one ``RetentionPolicy.addMessageLog`` call per
spacecraft -- both documented, verified mechanisms, see
``MonteCarlo/README.md``'s "Retain simulation data" section). There is no
per-run custom retention selection in the schema yet (e.g. "also retain
attitude" or "also retain a specific sensor") -- a reasonable v1 scope
given position/velocity dispersion spread is the headline Monte Carlo
question for a mission-analysis tool, extendable later without a schema
break (``MonteCarloConfig`` is a dataclass like everything else here).

Thread count
------------
``Controller.setThreadCount(n)`` for ``n > 1`` uses ``multiprocessing.Pool``
(confirmed by reading ``Controller.py`` directly). Python's
``multiprocessing`` needs the worker's target callables to be importable
(pickle-based "spawn"/"forkserver" start methods) or merely needs the
parent process state duplicated (fork). This module's creation/execution
functions are plain module-level functions (not closures) specifically so
they pickle cleanly either way, but the SCENARIO itself is threaded through
via ``functools.partial`` (also picklable, since :class:`Scenario` is a
plain dataclass tree of built-in types). This has NOT been exercised
against a real multi-process run in this project's development sandbox
(no Basilisk build here -- see this module's own verification-status note
below), so :data:`schema.scenario.MonteCarloConfig.thread_count` defaults
to the definitely-safe ``1``.

Verification status
--------------------
Requires a Basilisk build -- cannot be executed in this development
sandbox (no Basilisk build here; see ``SpaceMissionStudio/README.md``). Written
directly against ``src/utilities/MonteCarlo/Controller.py``,
``Dispersions.py``, and ``RetentionPolicy.py`` (read directly in this
checkout, including ``Controller``'s path-parsing internals) and against
that package's own ``README.md`` usage guide -- not from memory, and not
guessed.
