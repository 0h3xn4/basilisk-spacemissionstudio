Phase 2: builds the attitude navigation/guidance/control/actuation module
chain for one spacecraft -- kept separate from ``engine/service.py`` so
that file stays orchestration-only (build gravity, build spacecraft, call
into here once per spacecraft that wants attitude control).

Every call sequence below (module class names, attribute names,
``subscribeTo`` message wiring) is copied from an ACTUALLY RUNNING example
script in this checkout, not written from memory or guessed, per this
project's "never fabricate a Basilisk API" rule:

* ``simpleNav``, ``inertial3D`` + ``attTrackingError`` + ``mrpFeedback`` +
  ``rwMotorTorque`` + ``reactionWheelStateEffector`` + ``VehicleConfigMsg``:
  ``examples/scenarioAttitudeFeedbackRW.py``.
* ``hillPoint``, ``extForceTorque`` (idealized actuation) +
  ``scObject.addDynamicEffector``: ``examples/scenarioAttitudeGuidance.py``.
* ``velocityPoint``: ``examples/scenarioHohmann.py``.
* ``locationPointing`` + ``groundLocation.GroundLocation``:
  ``examples/scenarioAttLocPoint.py``.
* ``sunSafePoint`` (``sHatBdyCmd``/``minUnitMag``/``sunDirectionInMsg``/
  ``imuInMsg``): ``src/fswAlgorithms/attGuidance/sunSafePoint/_UnitTest/test_sunSafePoint.py``.
  ``sunSafePoint.imuInMsg`` is REQUIRED (``sunSafePoint.c`` raises
  ``BSK_ERROR`` via an ``isLinked()`` check if it is not connected) --
  confirmed by reading that source directly, not assumed. Both
  ``sunDirectionInMsg`` and ``imuInMsg`` are the same ``NavAttMsgPayload``
  type and ``simpleNav``'s single ``attOutMsg`` already carries both the
  ``vehSunPntBdy`` sun-heading field and ``omega_BN_B``, so both subscribe
  to the same ``simpleNav`` output -- there is no second sensor needed.
* ``magneticFieldWMM`` (``configureWMMFile``, ``addSpacecraftToModel``,
  ``envOutMsgs[i]`` indexed by call order):
  ``src/simulation/environment/magneticFieldWMM/_UnitTest/test_magneticFieldWMM.py``
  and that module's own ``.rst`` user guide.
* ``thrusterDynamicEffector`` + ``simIncludeThruster.thrusterFactory()`` +
  ``thrForceMapping`` + ``thrFiringSchmitt`` (the "thruster" actuator kind's
  control-torque path, replacing ``rwMotorTorque``/
  ``reactionWheelStateEffector``): ``examples/scenarioAttitudeFeedback2T_TH.py``.
* ``MtbEffector`` + ``tamComm`` + ``mtbMomentumManagement`` (continuous
  RW momentum management via magnetic torque rods,
  :func:`build_mtb_desaturation`), including the real, un-doctored
  ``rwMotorTorqueOutMsg``-sits-between-``rwMotorTorque``-and-the-RW
  -hardware wiring: ``examples/scenarioMtbMomentumManagement.py``, run
  directly against a real Basilisk build to confirm the exact wiring
  works (see this feature's ``HISTORY.md`` entry for the actual
  numbers) -- notably WITHOUT a ``magneticFieldWMM.epochInMsg``
  subscription, matching this file's own pre-existing
  ``build_magnetic_field_wmm()`` precedent (confirmed that omitting it,
  unlike the shipped example which sets one, does not break anything).
* ``thrMomentumManagement`` + ``thrForceMapping`` (momentum-dump mode,
  ``angErrThresh`` > pi) + ``thrMomentumDumping`` (RW desaturation via
  thrusters, :func:`build_momentum_dumping`), including the "re-``Reset()``
  after the first real tick" requirement that function's own docstring
  documents: ``examples/scenarioMomentumDumping.py``, and confirmed
  directly by running both with and without that extra ``Reset()`` call
  against a real Basilisk build (not assumed from the example's comment
  alone) -- see this feature's ``HISTORY.md`` entry for the actual
  before/after numbers.

Scoping decisions made explicit here (see ``engine/service.py``'s Phase 2
docstring for the full list):

* ``hillPoint``/``velocityPoint`` do NOT subscribe ``celBodyInMsg``: every
  orbit IC in this app is already given relative to ``gravity.central_body``
  (``central_body.isCentralBody = True``, matching every example scenario
  in this checkout), so the spacecraft's own ``r_BN_N``/``v_BN_N`` from
  ``simpleNav.transOutMsg`` is central-body-relative -- leaving
  ``celBodyInMsg`` unlinked is correct here, not a missing feature (see
  ``hillPoint.h``'s ``planetMsgIsLinked`` flag, which exists precisely to
  make this optional). This DEPENDS on ``engine/service.py`` setting
  ``spice_object.zeroBase = gravity.central_body`` (see that module's
  ``build()``): without it, the central body's own SPICE-linked position
  gets added into every spacecraft's ``r_BN_N``/``v_BN_N``
  (``GravityEffector::updateInertialPosAndVel()`` in
  ``gravityEffector.cpp`` always adds the central body's own position on
  top of the propagated central-body-relative state), which would make
  this assumption false again -- a real bug this project shipped and only
  caught once Basilisk actually ran end-to-end (see ``engine/service.py``'s
  ``zeroBase`` comment for the full explanation).
* ``locationPointing``'s ``fsw_params["target_body"]`` (point at a
  celestial body directly, vs. a ground station) is built via
  :func:`build_ephemeris_converter` (``SpicePlanetStateMsg`` ->
  ``EphemerisMsg``, confirmed against
  ``examples/scenarioAsteroidArrival.py``'s own usage) feeding
  ``locationPointing.celBodyInMsg`` -- ``engine.service`` builds one
  converter per targeted body from ``gravity.central_body``/
  ``gravity.third_body_perturbers``'s already-SPICE-tracked state
  messages, same source ``build_css_sun_estimation``'s sun direction and
  ``simpleNav``'s own truth sun heading already use.
* The attitude control loop is closed on TRUTH spacecraft state
  (``simpleNav``'s error model defaults to zero, i.e. ``PMatrix``/noise are
  left at Basilisk's own zero defaults unless a future phase adds a GUI/
  schema field for them) -- ``simpleNav`` is still the module in the loop
  (not raw ``scStateOutMsg``), so wiring in real navigation error later is
  a matter of setting its ``PMatrix``, not restructuring this chain.

Verification status: same as ``engine/service.py`` -- cannot be executed in
this development sandbox (no Basilisk build here), written directly
against the verified call sequences cited above.

    This dedicated CSS cluster is intentionally separate from
    :func:`attach_sensors`'s own per-sensor ``coarse_sun_sensor`` output
    messages, same reasoning as :func:`build_mtb_desaturation`'s dedicated
    TAM: those exist for user-visible per-sensor telemetry (one message
    per sensor); ``cssWlsEst`` needs ONE aggregate ``CSSArraySensorMsgPayload``
    across the whole cluster, which only Basilisk's ``CSSConstellation``
    container produces (confirmed directly against
    ``examples/BskSim/models/BSK_Dynamics.py``'s/``BSK_Fsw.py``'s own
    ``SetCSSConstellation()``/``SetCSSWlsEst()`` -- notably, individual
    ``CoarseSunSensor`` devices are NEVER added to the sim task directly
    in that reference; only the ``CSSConstellation`` container is, which
    drives each device's own update internally).

    Verification note: confirmed directly against a real Basilisk build
    that this chain's accuracy is governed entirely by sensor GEOMETRY
    (how many of the cluster's sensors are actually sunlit for a given
    sun direction, not a module bug) -- a sun direction illuminating only
    2 of this function's 8-sensor layout gave a 14.5-degree error (an
    under-determined 3-axis WLS fit from too few active sensors), while a
    direction illuminating 4 gave an EXACT match (0.0-degree error, zero
    sensor noise). Real spacecraft CSS clusters have exactly this
    direction-dependent coverage gap; it is not something to "fix" here.

    Returns ``(nav_state_out_msg, css_devices)`` -- the SECOND element is
    NOT optional to discard. Caught directly as a real, reproducible
    segfault: ``CSSConstellation.sensorList`` does not take ownership of
    the ``CoarseSunSensor`` Python objects assigned to it (only a
    reference) -- if ``css_devices`` is a purely-local list (e.g. this
    function's own, if it didn't return it), Python garbage-collects the
    devices once the function returns, and Basilisk segfaults inside
    ``InitializeSimulation()``/``ExecuteSimulation()`` on the now-dangling
    reference, with no error message pointing at the cause. Confirmed by
    reproducing it both ways (segfaults when discarded, works when kept
    alive) against a real Basilisk build -- the same category of lifetime
    hazard this codebase's own Vizard wiring already documents
    (``access_indicator_bridges``/``generic_storage_list``/
    ``generic_sensor_list`` -- "the caller MUST keep ALL FOUR alive").

    ``AccessMsg.hasAccess`` from ``engine.fsw.build_ground_location``/
    ``add_access_analysis`` -- never a manually-specified time window.

    This switches only the attitude REFERENCE/error fed downstream to
    :func:`build_mrp_feedback` -- the spacecraft's own integrated
    attitude STATE is untouched by the switch itself (this module writes
    no torque/force directly), so the existing closed-loop MRP

    exactly as it would for any other reference change. That is what
    makes the Sun-pointing <-> ground-station-pointing transition a
    genuine physically-simulated slew rather than an instantaneous
    attitude jump: nothing here resets ``sigma_BN``, there is no state
    to reset.

    Not built from a single official Basilisk example (unlike every
    other module this file wires up) because there isn't one for this
    specific orchestration -- instead follows TWO patterns already

    ``engine.service._extract_results``" convention
    ``engine.orbit_maintenance``'s own controllers (e.g.
    ``StationKeepingController``) already use -- see that class for the
    identical shape (``tLog``/a state log/etc., a ``Reset()``, an
    ``UpdateState()``).

    each wheel toward ``config.wheel_speed_biases_rad_s`` using whatever
