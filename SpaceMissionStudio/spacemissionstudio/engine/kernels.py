SPICE kernel / support-data management: a thin, GUI-facing wrapper over
Basilisk's own versioned fetch/cache
(``Basilisk.utilities.supportDataTools.dataFetcher``, which fetches via
``pooch`` and caches locally -- this is real, native Basilisk
infrastructure, not something this module reimplements), adding a status
report so the app is never silently trusting a file the user can't see
or verify.

**Closed-off/offline policy**: SpaceMissionStudio itself must never touch
the network except during installation (real user requirement -- "the
app must be completely closed off and offline, only exception is the
installation process"). Every ``packaging/`` installer
(``install.sh``/``install.ps1``/``deb/DEBIAN/postinst``/
``windows/bootstrap_env.ps1``) now calls :func:`require_kernels` with NO
arguments right after installing Basilisk -- its default,
:data:`ALL_SUPPORT_DATA_FILES`, covers every ``dataFetcher``-backed file
ANY of this app's own code paths read (confirmed by grepping every
``get_path()``/``DataFile.`` call site in ``engine/``/``gui/``: the four
SPICE ephemeris kernels :func:`build_spice_interface` needs, plus
``LocalGravData.GGM03S`` -- spherical-harmonics gravity, ``engine.service``
-- and ``MagneticFieldData.WMM`` -- magnetometer sensors,
``engine.fsw.build_magnetic_field_wmm``), so that first (and only) fetch
warms Basilisk's own local ``pooch`` cache for good: every later
``get_path()`` call, for the rest of this install's lifetime, resolves
from that cache with no network touched at all (``pooch``'s own fetch
-from-cache behavior, not something this module reimplements). This
module's own :func:`build_spice_interface`/:func:`require_kernels` calls
therefore run ONLY against an already-warm cache in normal operation --
if one of them still needs the network (a missing/corrupted cache entry),
that is treated as a configuration problem to fix by re-running the
installer, not a background feature this app silently falls back on; see
:class:`KernelError`'s own message for exactly that.

Requires a Basilisk build (imports ``Basilisk.utilities...``). Written
directly against the verified ``dataFetcher``/``spiceKernels``/
``simIncludeGravBody`` source in this checkout (not from memory).

Verification status: this module's CODE PATHS (the ``ensure_kernels``/
``require_kernels``/``build_spice_interface`` call sequence, and the clear
``KernelError`` it raises on failure) were exercised for real against a
genuine Basilisk build (``pip install "bsk[all]"`` -- see
``SpaceMissionStudio/README.md``'s "Getting started" section), and behaved
exactly as designed. The actual KERNEL DOWNLOAD could not be completed in
that same environment: its network egress to ``naif.jpl.nasa.gov`` (and
the ``hanspeterschaub.info`` backup mirror ``dataFetcher`` itself falls
back to) was blocked, so every kernel fetch failed there -- correctly
surfaced as a specific ``KernelError`` naming each kernel and the
underlying network error, never a silent hang or a bare traceback. On a
machine with ordinary internet access this same code should fetch and
cache the kernels normally; that path specifically (the download
succeeding) remains unverified.
