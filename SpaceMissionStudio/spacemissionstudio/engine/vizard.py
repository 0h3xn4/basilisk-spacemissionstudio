Vizard integration: satisfies the user's explicit "no embedded 3D viewer is
okay, as long as you ... provide good Vizard visualization with valuable
'live simulation data'" requirement.

Vizard is a separate, precompiled Unity application -- it cannot be
embedded in a Qt window (confirmed during the pre-Phase-0 capability audit;
see SpaceMissionStudio/README.md), so this module wraps Basilisk's own
``vizSupport.enableUnityVisualization()``, which either streams live to a
running Vizard instance over TCP (``liveStream=True`` -- the user launches
Vizard themselves and this app just feeds it) or writes a ``.bin``
playback file Vizard opens afterward (``saveFile=...``). Both modes are
native Basilisk functionality; nothing here reimplements or emulates
Vizard's rendering.

"Live simulation data", concretely, for what ``engine.service`` actually
wires up in Phase 2:

* Reaction wheel speeds/torques -- passed via ``rwEffectorList``, which
  makes Vizard draw its native per-wheel speed/torque bars. Only present
  for spacecraft with ``"reaction_wheel"`` actuators (see ``engine.fsw``);
  ``None`` otherwise, matching ``enableUnityVisualization``'s own
  ``ensure_correct_len_list`` handling of a per-spacecraft ``None`` entry.
* Thruster plumes -- passed via ``thrEffectorList``, which makes Vizard
  draw native thruster plume effects when firing. Only present for
  spacecraft with ``"thruster"`` actuators; ``None`` otherwise. Confirmed
  directly against ``src/utilities/vizSupport.py`` that this parameter
  wants a per-spacecraft LIST of ``ThrusterDynamicEffector`` instances
  (``depth=2``, unlike ``rwEffectorList``'s single instance per
  spacecraft -- a spacecraft could in principle have more than one
  separate thruster cluster, e.g. ACS + DV, though ``engine.fsw`` only
  ever builds one per spacecraft), so each non-``None`` entry here is
  wrapped in a one-element list before being passed through.
* Ground stations -- drawn via ``vizSupport.addLocation`` (lat/lon/alt,
  field of view, minimum-elevation cone) for every
  :class:`schema.scenario.GroundStationConfig`, so the access geometry
  ``locationPointing``/``groundLocation`` compute is actually visible in
  Vizard, not just in a CSV.
* Attitude, position, and (natively, always) eclipse/sun-direction
  indication come from ``enableUnityVisualization``'s own per-spacecraft
  state message wiring -- no extra work needed here.

Default camera / orbit-line view (fixed after user feedback that Vizard
opened locked onto the spacecraft with no context -- "improve" per that
feedback, since a viewer that opens on an unrecognizable close-up isn't
"understandable live data" no matter what panels are attached to it)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
``enableUnityVisualization()`` on its own does not configure the VIEWER's
starting camera or orbit-trace lines at all -- those are separate fields
on the ``VizSettings`` message it creates (``viz.settings``), read
directly from ``src/simulation/vizard/_GeneralModuleFiles/vizStructures.h``
in this checkout (not guessed): ``mainCameraTarget`` ("if a valid
spacecraft or celestial body name is provided, the main camera will be
targeted at that body at start"), ``orbitLinesOn``/``trueTrajectoryLinesOn``
(osculating/true orbit trace lines, off by default), and the
``show*Labels`` flags. Left unset, Vizard falls back to its own built-in
default, which is a spacecraft-locked view with no orbit trace -- exactly
the complaint. :func:`enable_vizard` now sets these explicitly: camera
targeted at the central body (an Earth-centered view with the orbit
tracing around it, matching STK/GMAT/FreeFlyer's default framing) unless
:attr:`VizardRequest.camera_target` names something else (a specific
spacecraft, to watch it up close, or another body), plus both orbit-trace
line types and spacecraft/body labels on.

Verification status: ``vizSupport.enableUnityVisualization``'s signature
and ``addLocation``'s signature were read directly from
``src/utilities/vizSupport.py`` in this checkout (not assumed); the
``rwEffectorList``/``saveFile``/``liveStream`` usage pattern matches
``examples/scenarioAttitudeFeedbackRW.py``. The ``VizSettings`` fields
this module now sets were confirmed to exist under these exact names by
reading ``vizStructures.h`` directly; a real user's own running Vizard
instance (a screenshot of the ``05_formation_flying_phasing`` template)
has since confirmed the camera/orbit-line/spacecraft-label behavior
documented here matches exactly what was intended -- this development
sandbox itself still has no display to confirm rendered results with,
but that specific gap is now closed by a real report, not left assumed.

Live-data panels (fixed after user feedback that the live Vizard stream
wasn't "understandable" -- a moving dot with no other readout doesn't
answer "is the battery draining, is the tank running dry, is this pass
actually in contact with the ground")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three more ``VizSettings``/``vizInterface`` structures, all populated from
REAL, already-simulated messages (nothing here is a static snapshot or an
analytical estimate -- see each source module's own docstring):

* **Battery state of charge** -- a Vizard ``GenericStorage`` bar panel per
  spacecraft with ``PowerConfig`` configured, wired directly to that
  spacecraft's ``simpleBattery.SimpleBattery.batPowerOutMsg``
  (``engine.service``). Pattern copied from
  ``examples/MultiSatBskSim/scenariosMultiSat/scenario_StationKeepingMultiSat.py``
  (a real, shipped Basilisk example -- not guessed).
* **Station-keeping propellant remaining** -- a second ``GenericStorage``
  panel per spacecraft with ``StationKeepingConfig`` configured, wired to
  ``engine.orbit_maintenance.StationKeepingController.fuelTankOutMsg`` (a
  real ``FuelTankMsgPayload`` that controller publishes specifically for
  this -- see its own module docstring). Same example's pattern for the
  "Tank" panel.
* **Delta-V used** -- one more ``GenericStorage`` panel per spacecraft
  with ``StationKeepingConfig`` configured ("SK Delta-V",
  ``StationKeepingController.deltaVOutMsg``), plus, for a spacecraft that
  ALSO has ``PhasingKeepingConfig`` configured, a second one ("Phasing
  Delta-V", ``PhasingKeepingController.deltaVOutMsg``) -- kept SEPARATE
  from station-keeping's own (see that controller's docstring for why:
  both draw from the one shared tank, but reporting them separately shows
  the propellant cost of altitude-keeping and phasing-keeping
  individually). Both are real ``DataStorageStatusMsgPayload`` messages
  those controllers publish specifically for this (see their own module
  docstring) -- deliberately not a second ``FuelTankMsgPayload`` reuse, so
  the propellant and delta-V panels are never racing to overwrite the
  same message.
* **Fuel tank remaining** -- a ``GenericStorage`` panel per spacecraft with
  a real ``schema.scenario.FuelTankConfig`` "fuel_tank" state effector
  configured (``engine.fsw.build_fuel_tank``), labeled "Fuel Tank" and
  wired to that effector's own ``fuelTankOutMsg`` -- a codebase-audit
  completeness fix: every other actuator-management feature
  (``station_keeping``, ``phasing_keeping``) already got a matching
  live-Vizard panel the moment it shipped, but a real ``fuelTank`` state
  effector (as opposed to ``StationKeepingController``'s own hand-rolled
  propellant scalar) had none until now. Deliberately a DIFFERENT label
  from station-keeping's own "Propellant" panel above -- the two track
  physically different, independent propellant pools (this one backs a
  "thruster" actuator's attitude-control/momentum-dumping hardware, not
  a reboost burn) and can both be present on the same spacecraft at once.
* **RTN separation from chief** -- THREE more ``GenericStorage`` panels,
  labeled by :func:`_rtn_panel_label` (e.g. "R vs chief-1"/"T vs
  chief-1"/"N vs chief-1" -- naming WHICH chief, not just the axis; see
  that function's own docstring) for a spacecraft with
  ``PhasingKeepingConfig`` configured, from
  ``PhasingKeepingController.separationRadialOutMsg``/
  ``...TransverseOutMsg``/``...NormalOutMsg`` -- the REAL chief/follower
  offset in the chief's own Hill frame (``orbitalMotion.rv2hill``, the
  exact same function ``engine.formation``'s wizard itself uses to place
  a follower), not an abstract single scalar. Real user feedback, across
  three rounds: first that a single "Separation" number was too vague to
  interpret; then that it should be broken out into the same R/T/N terms
  the wizard itself already uses; then (this round) two more issues with
  that breakout -- see ``PhasingKeepingController``'s own docstring for
  the full reasoning on both, and "Real bug found from a real running
  Vizard screenshot, THIRD occurrence" below for the first one
  (``storageLevel`` is ``abs()``-clamped to ``[0, storageCapacity]``,
  MAGNITUDE only, unlike an earlier revision's signed, symmetric clamp)
  -- shared ``storageCapacity`` across all three panels is unchanged.
* **Live numeric values are Vizard's OWN, not this module's.** A real
  screenshot (from an actual user) showed every ``GenericStorage`` panel
  rendering its own live ``"<currentValue> / <maxValue> <units>"``
  readout natively, in a column separate from ``label`` -- this module
  briefly (mis-)diagnosed that as missing and added a custom
  ``_LiveValueLabelBridge`` that rewrote ``label`` itself to embed the
  same numbers as text; a SECOND real screenshot showed that text
  getting cut off (Vizard truncates a panel row's ``label`` at a fixed
  width, independent of how wide the panel itself grows for its own
  native readout column), which is what led to noticing the native
  column was there all along. Reverted: panel labels are short, static
  names ("SK Delta-V"/"Phasing Delta-V"/:func:`_rtn_panel_label`'s
  output, not the longer names an earlier version used -- still within
  that same fixed per-row width, confirmed against the same screenshot's
  truncation of "Delta-V (station-keeping)"), and Vizard's own native
  column is what shows the live numbers.
* **Ground-station access windows** -- one ``GenericSensor`` marker per
  (ground station, spacecraft) pair that Phase 3's access analysis tracks,
  changing color LIVE between "no access" and "access" as
  ``groundLocation.GroundLocation``'s already-computed ``hasAccess`` flag
  changes each tick. ``GenericSensor`` has no boolean/message-driven color
  input on its own -- it takes an integer "mode" via a
  ``DeviceCmdMsgPayload``, so :func:`enable_vizard` adds one small bridge
  ``SysModel`` per pair (defined locally inside this function, not at
  module scope, to keep this module's own Basilisk import lazy -- see
  below) that republishes ``AccessMsgPayload.hasAccess`` as that command
  value. **Real bug found directly from Vizard's own Unity source**
  (``0h3xn4/vizard``, ``GenericSensorHUDMethods.cs``'s ``FixedUpdate``/
  ``getModeColor``), not from a screenshot this time -- reported as part
  of a real user complaint that a related panel (see the next bullet)
  "wasn't showing anything": mode 0 is NOT just "the 0th color" the way
  ``vizStructures.h``'s own field comment implies -- that value is
  hardwired to mean "fade the indicator to fully hidden," REGARDLESS of
  what color is supplied for it. A ``GenericSensor`` commanded 0 for most
  of a run (as "no access" was here) spends nearly all of that run
  invisible, not shown in some default/off color -- which reads to a user
  as "this panel isn't there," not "this panel is currently off." Mode
  1 and 2 are the two values that actually map to the two user-supplied
  colors (``modeColors[1]``/``modeColors[2]`` -- index 0 of that internal
  list is a hardcoded default the Unity code never lets a caller
  override). Fixed: the bridge now commands 1 for no-access and 2 for
  access -- never 0 -- so BOTH states render as a persistently visible,
  distinctly colored marker instead of one of them being an invisible
  no-op. This marker's position/boresight (``r_SB_B``/``normalVector``)
  is a placeholder (body origin, +X) since neither the schema nor
  Basilisk's ``groundLocation`` model a real antenna mounting direction
  -- it is a status indicator, not an antenna visualization (compare
  ``Transceiver``/comm-ring visualization, which needs a real data-node
  system this project does not have -- see ``PowerConfig``'s docstring on
  scope).
* **comms_pointing mode, pointing error, and RF link status** -- real
  user feedback: "the mission panel live stream shall also be in the
  vizard live visualization, not only in the GUI itself" (referring to
  ``gui.mission_dashboard_widget.MissionDashboardWidget``, template 19's
  GUI counterpart). Three more entries per spacecraft with
  ``schema.scenario.CommsPointingConfig`` set, all sourced DIRECTLY from
  ``engine.fsw.build_comms_pointing``'s own arbitrator (no new bridge
  ``SysModel`` needed here -- unlike ground-station access above, that
  arbitrator already computes and publishes these every tick for its own
  reasons): a "Pointing Error" ``GenericStorage`` bar (``theta_deg``,
  always non-negative by construction -- see that arbitrator's own
  ``UpdateState``, so this one never risks the negative-``storageLevel``
  "Unavailable" bug the RTN panels hit); a "Mode" ``GenericSensor`` badge
  (Sun-pointing vs. ground-station-pointing, same 1/2
  ``DeviceCmdMsgPayload`` convention as the access indicator -- see that
  bullet's own real-Vizard-source finding on why 0 is never one of the
  two values); and a
  "Link status" ``GenericSensor`` badge (link OK vs. no/degraded link),
  computed live inside the arbitrator from ``engine.link_budget.link_margin_db``
  -- the SAME pure-Python function and the SAME gating
  (real access AND actually comms-pointing) ``gui.mission_dashboard_widget``
  and ``engine.link_budget.link_margin_series`` already use for their own
  numbers, so Vizard's badge and the GUI's detailed breakdown can never
  silently disagree about whether the link is "up". Deliberately a
  colored status badge, not a numeric margin bar: a real margin can be
  negative (a degraded link is exactly the state worth seeing), and
  ``GenericStorage`` has no non-negative-only workaround that doesn't lose
  the sign -- see the RTN-panel bug above for why that was already tried
  and reverted once for a different panel.

None of this feeds back into simulated physics or the exported CSV/plot
data -- ``engine.service.run()`` already reports the same battery/
propellant/access/comms_pointing numbers there; this only makes them
visible live in Vizard too.

Verification status: the ``GenericStorage``/battery+fuel-tank wiring
matches a real, shipped multi-satellite Basilisk example line-for-line
(cited above), AND has since been confirmed rendering correctly against
a real running Vizard instance (the same screenshot cited above --
"Propellant"/"Delta-V"/"Separation" panels all visible and updating).
The R/T/N panels' MAGNITUDE fix (see "Real bug found from a real
running Vizard screenshot, FOURTH round" below) is confirmed TWO ways
now: against ``PhasingKeepingController``'s own real-Basilisk unit
tests (``storageLevel`` is genuinely non-negative and correctly
clamped), AND directly against Vizard's own Unity source
(``0h3xn4/vizard``,
``GenericStorageUnitMethods.cs``'s ``UpdateCurrentValue()``) -- a hard
``value >= 0`` branch with no tolerance, confirming a negative
``storageLevel`` really does render "Unavailable" unconditionally, not
inferred from field-comment wording. :func:`_rtn_panel_label`'s
truncation-width budget is likewise now computed directly from Vizard's
own panel-sizing code (:func:`_usable_label_width_px`) rather than a
flat constant confirmed against one screenshot -- see that function's
own docstring for the exact formula and its one remaining estimate
(characters-per-pixel, since this project has no access to the actual
TMP font's glyph metrics).
The ``GenericSensor``/``DeviceCmdMsgPayload``/bridge-module wiring
matches the field-level pattern in a second real shipped example
(``examples/scenarioGroundLocationImaging.py``), but the specific
"republish an access flag as a sensor mode" composition is this module's
own, not copied from an example verbatim, and -- unlike the
``GenericStorage`` panels above -- has NOT yet been confirmed against a
real running Vizard instance (that screenshot's scenario had no ground
stations configured).

**Real bug found on first actual run** (reported: ``basic_string::_M_create``,
a C++ ``std::length_error``, thrown well after setup completed, during an
otherwise-unrelated-looking string operation): every
``_AccessIndicatorBridge`` instance this function created was referenced
ONLY by a local loop variable -- ``engine.service`` discarded this
function's return value entirely, so nothing kept those Python objects
(or ``viz`` itself) alive past this function returning. Unlike the plain
-data ``vizInterface`` structs (``GenericStorage``/``GenericSensor``,
whose relevant state ``enableUnityVisualization()`` copies into its own
C++ containers), ``_AccessIndicatorBridge`` is a custom Python
``SysModel`` with virtual ``UpdateState``/``Reset`` methods Basilisk calls
back into via a SWIG director -- letting the Python side of that get
garbage-collected while the C++ side is still task-registered is
undefined behavior, and heap corruption manifesting later as an unrelated
string-construction crash is a textbook symptom. Every OTHER custom
Python ``SysModel`` in this codebase (this module's own
``StationKeepingController``/``PhasingKeepingController``,
``../missionAnalysis``'s ``PowerLoadGate``/``InstrumentEclipseGate``) is
deliberately kept alive by its caller storing the returned object
somewhere persistent; this bridge class was the one place that pattern
was broken.

First fix attempt -- also broken, caught on the next real run: attaching
every bridge instance to ``viz`` itself as ``viz._spacemissionstudio_access_
indicator_bridges``. ``viz`` is a SWIG proxy for a C++ ``VizInterface``,
and SWIG-generated proxy classes raise (not silently ignore) an attempt
to set any attribute they don't already know about -- confirmed against
a real run, which failed immediately with "You tried to add this
variable: _spacemissionstudio_access_indicator_bridges To this class:
<...VizInterface ...>" before a single simulation step ran. Fixed for
real by returning ``access_indicator_bridges`` alongside ``viz`` instead
of bolting it onto ``viz`` (see :func:`enable_vizard`'s own Returns
docs) and having ``engine.service`` retain BOTH (previously just
``viz``, and before that, neither) as plain attributes of its own
``SimulationService`` instance -- an ordinary Python object with no such
restriction -- for that instance's lifetime.

**Same bug found again, second occurrence, this time in GenericStorage**
(reported: same ``basic_string::_M_create``/``std::length_error``
signature as above, this time thrown from ``VizInterface::WriteProtobuffer()``
-> ``google::protobuf::internal::ArenaStringPtr::Set()`` on VizInterface's
own background write thread -- confirmed with a real ``gdb``
``catch throw``/``bt`` on an otherwise-clean, fully-isolated repro: a
station-keeping-only scenario, headless CLI, no live Vizard connection,
just ``--vizard-save-file``). The paragraph above's claim that
``GenericStorage``/``GenericSensor`` don't need this same retention --
because their "relevant state is copied into Basilisk's own C++
containers by ``enableUnityVisualization()``" -- was never actually
verified against ``vizStructures.h`` and turned out to be wrong:
``VizSpacecraftData::genericStorageList``/``genericSensorList`` are
``std::vector<GenericStorage *>``/``std::vector<GenericSensor *>`` --
POINTER vectors, not value vectors. ``enableUnityVisualization()`` only
stores the pointers it's handed; it does not clone the pointed-to
structs. The ``panel``/``sensor`` objects built in the loop below (and
their embedded ``tank_reader``/``battery_reader``/``cmd_reader``
``ReadFunctor``s) were local variables, never returned, never retained
by ``engine.service`` -- garbage-collected the moment this function
returned, while ``VizInterface`` kept dangling pointers to them and
dereferenced one every tick in ``WriteProtobuffer()``, eventually
reading freed/reused memory as a corrupt string length. Only
spacecraft with a ``GenericStorage``/``GenericSensor`` panel (i.e. only
``station_keeping``/ground-station-access scenarios -- never
``constant_thrust``, which creates no panel at all) can hit this,
which is exactly the split a long real-repro investigation across
several scenario variants eventually converged on before this was
found. Fixed the same way as the bridge fix: ``generic_storage_list``/
``generic_sensor_list`` (built below, parallel per-spacecraft lists)
are now returned alongside ``viz``/``access_indicator_bridges`` (see
:func:`enable_vizard`'s own Returns docs) and ``engine.service`` retains
all four for the ``SimulationService`` instance's lifetime.

**Real UX bug found from a real running Vizard screenshot** (a genuine
user report, not this project's own repro -- the FIRST real look at any
of this module's panels actually rendered): the phasing-formation
"Separation from chief" ``GenericStorage`` bar rendered broken --
overflowing its own panel box, full window width, unlike the compact
"Propellant"/"Delta-V" bars right next to it in the same screenshot.
Root cause: that panel's ``storageCapacity`` was set to the along-track
TARGET separation itself, so ordinary, ON-TARGET holding already sat at
~100% fill with zero headroom, and a real correction transient (this
project's own manual repro, once alerted to look: a fresh scenario's
initial along-track mismatch, well before the controller has converged)
pushed ``storageLevel`` well past ``storageCapacity`` -- confirmed
directly against a real Basilisk run, not just theorized: a 600 s manual
repro read back ``storageLevel`` at over 4x ``storageCapacity`` before
the fix. Vizard does not appear to clamp an overflowing bar itself.
Fixed in ``engine.orbit_maintenance.PhasingKeepingController.UpdateState``:
the gauge now gets 2x the target as headroom, and the value actually
WRITTEN to the separation message is clamped to that capacity (``min()``,
confirmed against the same manual repro to now read exactly at the
capacity rather than 4x it) -- the true, unclamped number is kept
separately (plain Python attributes) for anything that needs it.
Same screenshot ALSO seemed to show every panel's ``label`` as static
text (e.g. "Propellant"), never a live number -- first "fixed" by adding
a ``_LiveValueLabelBridge`` that rewrote ``label`` itself every tick to
embed the current/max value as text. A SECOND real screenshot (the
follow-up report) showed that this was solving a problem Vizard didn't
have: it already renders a live ``"<currentValue> / <maxValue> <units>"``
readout natively, in a column separate from ``label`` -- invisible in
the FIRST screenshot only because the panel was narrow at the time, not
because it doesn't exist. The label-bridge text, once long enough to
embed real numbers, then got cut off by a fixed-width truncation on each
row's own ``label`` area (unrelated to the native readout column, which
doesn't share that limit) -- exactly what the second screenshot showed
("Delta-V (station-keeping): 0" cut off mid-word). Reverted entirely:
panel labels are short, static names again, and Vizard's own native
column is what shows live values -- see this module's "Live-data panels"
section above for the current, much simpler design.

That same follow-up report also caught a SEPARATE, deeper bug, this
time in ``engine.formation`` rather than here: the wizard-generated
follower's along-track separation (what the ``phasing_keeping`` control
law is actually supposed to hold) was reading wildly larger than
requested. Root-caused to ``engine.formation.generate_phasing_follower``
placing the ENTIRE requested (R, T, N) Hill-frame offset via a single
``hill2rv`` call from the chief's state -- confirmed, independent of
offset size, that ``orbitalMotion.rv2elem()`` decomposing a
near-circular state built that way puts essentially the WHOLE
along-track angle into ``omega`` (argument of periapsis), never into
``f`` (true anomaly), so ``PhasingKeepingController``'s ``f``-only
mean-anomaly tracking read the follower as already on target and never
corrected anything -- see ``engine.formation``'s own module docstring
for the fix (place T as a direct mean-anomaly shift; layer R/N on
afterward) and the full numerical confirmation.

A THIRD round of feedback on the same panels, after both fixes above:
the single "Separation" scalar (even correctly clamped) was still too
abstract to interpret -- a user could see a number and a bar, but not
what it actually meant geometrically. Replaced with the three
``separationRadialOutMsg``/``separationTransverseOutMsg``/
``separationNormalOutMsg`` panels described in "Live-data panels" above,
each a REAL ``orbitalMotion.rv2hill`` decomposition (not the control
law's own mean-anomaly-difference approximation) in the same R/T/N terms
``engine.formation``'s wizard already asks for -- so the number Vizard
shows during a run and the number a user typed into the wizard beforehand
are directly comparable.

**Real bug found from a real running Vizard screenshot, FOURTH round**
(a real user report on the R/T/N panels from the round above): the
Radial and Normal panels showed "Unavailable" instead of a number/bar,
while Transverse (right next to them, same panel construction) rendered
normally. Root cause: ``PhasingKeepingController.UpdateState`` clamped
``storageLevel`` SYMMETRICALLY at that point (``[-storageCapacity,
storageCapacity]``, sign preserved, so a trailing vs. leading follower
would still read with the correct sign) -- but GenericStorage's own
field comments, in both ``vizStructures.h`` and the wire-format
``vizMessage.proto`` (``"current/maximum absolute value of the storage
device"``), document ``currentValue``/``maxValue`` as a non-negative
gauge, the same kind of quantity as the battery/propellant/delta-V
panels right next to it. At the screenshot's moment Radial and Normal
happened to be negative and Transverse happened to be positive -- which
lines up with a non-negative-only widget rejecting a negative value it
was never designed to receive.

CONFIRMED directly, not just inferred from field-comment wording: the
Vizard Unity source (``0h3xn4/vizard``, cloned separately -- Vizard's
own client was previously assumed closed-source/unavailable to this
project, which turned out not to be the case) shows exactly this.
``GenericStorageUnitMethods.cs``'s ``UpdateCurrentValue()`` reads:

.. code-block:: csharp

    float value = (float) myMsg.CurrentValue;
    ...
    if (value >= 0) { /* normal bar + "<value> / <maxValue> <units>" */ }
    else
    {
        hoverText.text = "Unavailable";
        verboseText.text = "Unavailable";   // "Stale" in VR
        verboseText.color = Color.gray;
        measurementRect.GetComponent<Image>().color = Color.gray;
        measurementRect.sizeDelta = new Vector2(0, barHeight);
    }

A hard ``value >= 0`` branch, unconditional, with no tolerance for a
small negative number and nothing to do with ``maxValue`` or color
thresholds -- exactly what the screenshot's positive/negative split
showed. Fixed in
``PhasingKeepingController.UpdateState``/``_clamp_magnitude`` (see that
function's own docstring): ``storageLevel`` now publishes ``abs()``,
clamped to ``[0, storageCapacity]`` -- MAGNITUDE, not signed direction.
This is a real, honest trade-off, not a full fix: Vizard's live panels
can no longer show "ahead of"/"behind the chief" the way the previous
(broken) revision intended to; the signed numbers remain available as
``lastRadialKm``/``lastTransverseKm``/``lastNormalKm`` on the controller
itself for anything that needs them, just not live in Vizard.

The SAME round of feedback also asked a separate, simpler question: the
panels never said WHOSE offset they were measuring -- "Radial (R)" on a
follower's own storage panel doesn't say which chief it's relative to.
Fixed by :func:`_rtn_panel_label`, which folds the chief spacecraft's
own name (``PhasingKeepingController.chiefName``, wired by
:func:`build_phasing_keeping` from ``chief_sc_object.ModelTag``) into
the label itself (e.g. "R vs chief-1") instead of a bare axis letter --
see that function's own docstring for the truncation-width budget this
has to stay inside, computed per-scenario from the follower
spacecraft's own name (Vizard's panel width scales with it -- not a
flat constant).

    ``GenericStoragePanelMethods.cs``'s ``InitializePanel()`` builds
    ``panelName = spacecraftName + " Storage"`` and, only if that
    exceeds 16 characters, widens ``barWidth`` to
    ``panelName.Length * 7`` (pixels) -- applied via ``SetBarWidth()``
    UNIFORMLY to every storage-device row in that spacecraft's own
    panel, so the same bar width (and hence label width) is shared by
    every row regardless of that row's own label length. A SHORT
    spacecraft name (``len(name) + len(" Storage") <= 16``, i.e. 8
    characters or fewer) never triggers the widening, leaving the
    panel at the hardcoded 90px default -- narrower than the 123px a
    real confirming screenshot (spacecraft named "follower-1", 10
    characters) actually exercised.

    ``GenericStorageUnitMethods.cs``'s own prefab
    (``GenericStoragePanelUnit.prefab``) shows the ``deviceName`` TMP
    text box is anchor-stretched inside that same bar's
    ``backgroundRect`` with ``sizeDelta = {x: -3, y: 15}`` -- so usable
    label width is ``barWidth - 3`` pixels. That same prefab confirms
    the render mode this all matters for: ``m_enableAutoSizing: 0``
