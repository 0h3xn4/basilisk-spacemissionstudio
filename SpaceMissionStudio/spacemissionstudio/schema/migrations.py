Scenario schema migrations: one function per version bump, applied in
order by :func:`migrate` so a scenario file written by an older version of
this tool keeps loading correctly.

Adding a migration
-------------------
When a change to ``schema.scenario`` would break older files (a field
renamed/removed/re-typed -- purely *additive* fields with a sensible
default do NOT need a migration, since ``from_dict`` already tolerates
missing keys via dataclass defaults):

1. Bump ``schema.scenario.CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`` by one.
2. Add a ``_migrate_<old>_to_<new>(data: dict) -> dict`` function here that
   transforms a raw dict at the OLD version into one valid at the NEW
   version, and sets ``data["schema_version"] = <new>``.
3. Register it in ``MIGRATIONS`` keyed by the OLD version number.

:func:`migrate` then walks forward one step at a time from whatever
version the file declares up to ``CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION``, so a very old
file still loads even after several schema versions have shipped.

    """v1 -> v2: ``SpaceWeatherConfig.source`` dropped ``"celestrak"`` --
    the closed-off/offline policy change removed this app's own ability
    to fetch it automatically at RUN time (see ``engine.spaceweather``'s
    own "Closed-off/offline policy" docstring); it is no longer a valid
    ``source`` value at all. ``"celestrak"`` was also the v1 DEFAULT, so
    this covers essentially every scenario file ever saved by an older
    version of this tool, not just ones that explicitly chose it.

    Rewrites ``space_weather.source == "celestrak"`` to ``"synthetic"``
    -- the same safe, always-available, no-file/no-network default this
    tool itself now falls back to. A ``"conservative"`` activity_level
    paired with the old ``"celestrak"`` source is downgraded to
    ``"nominal"`` too: ``"conservative"`` is now ``"local_file"``-only
    (see ``SpaceWeatherConfig``'s own docstring), so migrating only
    ``source`` would otherwise still leave a file that LOADS fine but
    fails the moment it's actually resolved at run time, with no schema
    -level warning anywhere along the way.
