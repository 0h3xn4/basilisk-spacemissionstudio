r"""
The scenario file format: a versioned, human-readable JSON schema for
everything needed to define and run a mission-analysis case (spacecraft
config, orbit initial conditions, epoch, central body, sensors/actuators,
FSW mode, ground stations).

Deliberately dependency-light: standard-library ``dataclasses`` + hand
-written validation, not a pickled Python object and not a third-party
schema library (pydantic, etc.) -- consistent with keeping the backend
service layer's own dependency footprint small (Basilisk itself, plus
whatever the GUI needs, is already enough surface area). This module has
NO Basilisk import and is fully unit-testable without a Basilisk build --
see ``tests/test_scenario_schema.py``.

Versioning
----------
Every scenario file carries a top-level ``schema_version`` integer.
``load_scenario()`` runs the file through ``migrations.MIGRATIONS`` before
constructing a :class:`Scenario`, so old scenario files keep loading as the
schema grows -- see ``migrations.py``. Bump ``CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`` and
add a migration function whenever a field is added, renamed, or removed in
a way that would break an older file.

Phase 0 scope note
-------------------
This schema is intentionally more complete than what Phase 0's
``engine.service.SimulationService`` actually consumes (see that module's
docstring for exactly what Phase 0 wires up: central-body point-mass/
spherical-harmonics gravity, one or more spacecraft with classical
-elements/Cartesian/TLE initial conditions, propagation only). Fields for
sensors, actuators, FSW modes, and ground stations are validated here and
carried through save/load round-trips starting now, precisely so the
schema does not need a disruptive reshape once Phase 2/3 start consuming
them -- retrofitting schema versioning after the fact is much more
painful than reserving the shape up front.

class PhasingKeepingConfig:
    """Constellation-wide phasing maintenance: holds this (follower)
    spacecraft's along-track separation from a ``chief_spacecraft`` at a
    target value via a drift-orbit maneuver (a temporary semi-major-axis
    offset, natural drift, then a restoring burn) --
    ``engine.orbit_maintenance.PhasingKeepingController``, ported from
    ``../missionAnalysis``'s controller of the same name. Built for
    exactly the constellations ``engine.constellation`` generates (a set
    of co-planar, same-altitude satellites), but works for any two
    spacecraft sharing an orbital plane and altitude.

    Requires ``station_keeping`` to ALSO be set on this same spacecraft:
    phasing and altitude-keeping share ONE physical thruster and
    propellant tank (this config deliberately has no
    ``thrust_n``/``isp_s``/``propellant_kg`` fields of its own --
    ``engine.service`` reads those from ``station_keeping`` instead, so
    there is no way for the two to accidentally disagree about the same
    hardware), with altitude-keeping taking priority whenever both want to
    fire on the same tick -- see the controller's own docstring for why.

    ``target_separation_km`` is one or more along-track distances [km]
    ahead of the chief; with more than one entry, the target steps through
    them every ``reconfiguration_interval_days`` (holding at the last one
    once the list is exhausted) -- e.g. ``[1000, 500, 100]`` with
    ``reconfiguration_interval_days=90`` tightens the formation baseline
    roughly every 3 months. A single entry holds that separation for the
    whole mission. The remaining fields are maneuver-tuning knobs with
    reasonable ported defaults (``../missionAnalysis/mission_config.py``)
    -- widen ``tolerance_fraction``/``restore_tolerance_fraction`` for
    fewer, larger corrections, or narrow them for tighter formation
    -keeping at the cost of more frequent burns; there is no single
    "correct" answer, it depends on the mission's own ops concept.

    Caveat found by a real crash investigation: give this spacecraft's
    (and its ``chief_spacecraft``'s) orbit a small, deliberate, NONZERO
    ``eccentricity`` (e.g. ``0.001``) rather than exactly ``0.0``.
    ``engine.orbit_maintenance.PhasingKeepingController`` measures each
    spacecraft's along-track phase via ``orbitalMotion.rv2elem()``, which
    only trusts its stable near-circular formula below ``e < 1e-11`` --
    a genuinely circular scenario's real, propagated eccentricity (from
    third-body gravity, or this very controller's own commanded thrust)
    can easily drift just above that extremely tight threshold, at which
    point ``rv2elem()`` silently falls back to a formula that is
    numerically meaningless that close to zero eccentricity, feeding a
    garbage phasing error into this controller. See
    ``SpaceMissionStudio/HISTORY.md``'s "Template '05' crash" writeups for the
    full investigation (bundled template ``05_formation_flying_phasing``
    hit exactly this and was fixed the same way).

    fallback plan ("if fetching isn't possible I'll provide the file
    myself").

    ``atmosphere_model`` selects which Basilisk atmosphere-density model
    ``engine.service`` builds for ``enable_drag`` spacecraft:
    ``"nrlmsise00"`` (the original, only model this project used to wire
    up -- needs the ``source``/``activity_level`` space-weather machinery
    below) or ``"exponential"`` (Basilisk's ``ExponentialAtmosphere``, a
    simple per-planet scale-height model that ignores ``source``/
    ``activity_level``/``local_file_path`` entirely -- no F10.7/Ap
    dependence at all). ``engine.service`` configures it with Basilisk's
    own ``simSetPlanetEnvironment.exponentialAtmosphere()`` helper (the
    same sea-level Earth baseDensity/scaleHeight a real shipped Basilisk
    example, ``examples/scenarioDragDeorbit.py``, uses for its own
    exponential-model deorbit case -- not hand-picked constants). Confirmed
    directly against real Basilisk (a standalone density-recorder run, not
    guessed) that a single sea-level exponential decay under-predicts
    density at typical LEO altitudes by many orders of magnitude compared
    to NRLMSISE-00 -- an inherent limitation of this simple model, not a
    wiring bug: pick ``"exponential"`` for speed/simplicity (e.g. a quick
    order-of-magnitude check with no space-weather dependency), never for
    an accurate drag/decay estimate, which needs ``"nrlmsise00"``. Real
    user question: "why can't I select the
    atmospheric drag model, other tools let me choose Jacchia-Roberts or
    NRLMSISE-00" -- Basilisk (checked directly against its own
    ``src/simulation/environment/`` tree, not assumed) ships exactly
    three atmosphere models: ``MsisAtmosphere`` (NRLMSISE-00),
    ``ExponentialAtmosphere``, and ``TabularAtmosphere`` (a user-supplied
    altitude/density table, not wired up here -- would need a new file
    -upload schema/GUI concept of its own, out of scope for this round).
    There is no Jacchia-Roberts model in Basilisk at all, so that specific
    option genuinely cannot be offered here.

    ``activity_level``/``activity_percentile`` (``"nrlmsise00"`` only --
    ignored for ``"exponential"``) select a CONSERVATIVE, sustained-
    worst-case drag margin instead of the ordinary resolved space-weather
    data: see ``engine.spaceweather``'s own docstring, "Conservative
    ('worst-case') drag margin", for the real user request this
