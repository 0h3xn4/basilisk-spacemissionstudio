:func:`validate_all` -- a scenario-wide validation pass that reports EVERY
problem it finds in one call, with item paths, rather than stopping at the
first one.

Honest about what's actually collecting vs. what isn't
-----------------------------------------------------------
``Scenario.validate()`` (``schema/scenario.py``) and every resource
dataclass's own ``.validate()`` are UNCHANGED by this module -- still
raise-fast on the first problem via ``_require()``, exactly as before this
feature existed, preserving current behavior exactly (nothing calling
``Scenario.validate()``/``.save()``/``load_scenario()`` today sees any
different behavior). Rewriting ~15 existing raise-fast validators into
collecting ones would be a much larger, riskier change than this feature
needs, so this module does NOT attempt it. Concretely, that means
:func:`validate_all`'s output has two different granularities:

* **Resources** (gravity, spacecraft, ground stations, Monte Carlo, ...):
  AT MOST ONE message -- whatever ``scenario.validate()`` raises first, if
  anything. Fixing it may reveal another one on the next call, same as
  today.
* **Mission sequence** (``scenario.mission_sequence``): EVERY problem in
  EVERY command, each with its own item path -- ``Command.validate()``
  (``schema/command.py``) was written collecting from the start, and this
  function also collects every dangling spacecraft/ground-station
  reference across the whole sequence, not just the first one.

This asymmetry is deliberate and stated here rather than hidden -- true
"every resource AND every command error, all at once" would require
retrofitting the resource layer, which is out of scope for this change
unless separately requested.
