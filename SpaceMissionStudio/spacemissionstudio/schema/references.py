r"""
Reference-integrity utilities for a :class:`~spacemissionstudio.schema.scenario.Scenario`
-- "what refers to this spacecraft/ground station by name", used to back
two GMAT/FreeFlyer-style GUI behaviors neither this schema nor the GUI
layer has today:

* **Delete is refused** with a specific message listing every referencing
  item, instead of silently leaving a dangling name that only surfaces as
  a generic validation error much later (or not at all, if nothing ever
  re-validates). Before this module, ``gui.spacecraft_editor.
  SpacecraftListWidget._on_remove()``/``gui.ground_station_editor.
  GroundStationListWidget._on_remove()`` deleted unconditionally with NO
  reference check at all -- confirmed by reading both, this is a real,
  not hypothetical, gap.
* **Rename updates every reference** atomically (FreeFlyer's "rename
  symbol"), instead of leaving them pointing at a name that no longer
  exists.

Deliberately explicit, not a generic dataclass-field walker
-------------------------------------------------------------
Every reference site below is hand-listed, the same way
``Scenario.validate()`` already hand-lists every cross-reference check
(``phasing_keeping.chief_spacecraft in names``, ``dispersion.spacecraft in
names``, ``fsw_params['target_ground_station'] in gs_names``) rather than
reflecting over dataclass fields generically -- matching this schema's own
established style (explicit and easy to audit over generic and easy to
get subtly wrong), at the cost of needing a new entry here whenever a new
reference site is added elsewhere (e.g. a future ``Command`` kind that
targets a ground station). Kept in one place specifically so that's a
one-file change, the same discipline ``engine.monte_carlo``'s
``_QUANTITY_PATHS`` dict already documents for itself for the same reason.

``assignment`` and ``report`` commands are a deliberate, narrower
exception: ``assignment.target`` and each entry of ``report.series`` are
dotted path STRINGS (``"sat-1.station_keeping.thrust_n"``,
``"sat-1.position_N"``), not a clean dict key, so the reference is the
string's first path segment -- see :func:`_command_references` for
exactly how that's parsed, and its v1 limitation (these dotted targets
are assumed spacecraft-scoped; nothing else parses a dotted target yet).
