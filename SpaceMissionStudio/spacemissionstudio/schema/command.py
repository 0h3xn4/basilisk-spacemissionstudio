:class:`Command` -- the "Mission Sequence" half of a :class:`Scenario`,
alongside the resource fields (``gravity``, ``spacecraft``,
``ground_stations``, ...) that already existed before this module: a
scenario's ``mission_sequence`` is an ORDERED list of :class:`Command`,
walked in order by ``engine.mission_engine`` (not yet written -- this
module is the GUI/Basilisk-independent data model only, same split
``schema/scenario.py`` already uses).

Inspired by GMAT's Resources/Mission-Sequence split and FreeFlyer's
Objects/Mission-Sequence split, but deliberately NOT a port of either
tool's command set or object model -- see this project's own design
discussion for why: Basilisk's continuous feedback controllers
(``engine.orbit_maintenance``), message/recorder architecture, and native
event mechanism (``SimulationBaseClass.EventHandlerClass``) are each, in
their own area, a better fit than copying GMAT/FreeFlyer's shape wholesale
would be -- this schema only borrows the ORGANIZING idea (resources vs.
time-ordered sequence), not the object model underneath it.

One envelope dataclass, not one Python class per command kind
-----------------------------------------------------------------
:class:`Command` has a ``kind: str`` discriminator plus a loosely-typed
``params: dict``, exactly the same shape ``SpacecraftConfig`` already uses
for ``SensorConfig``/``ActuatorConfig`` (``kind`` + ``params``) and for
``fsw_params`` (mode-specific keys in one dict rather than one dataclass
per FSW mode) -- chosen for the same reason those were: command kinds need
very different parameter shapes, and a dataclass-per-kind would also need
a discriminated-union (de)serialization mechanism this schema doesn't have
anywhere else. ``Command.validate()`` is where each kind's specific shape
is actually enforced, matching how ``engine/fsw.py``'s per-mode builders
are where ``fsw_params``' shape is enforced today.

Minimum command set (per this project's current scope decision)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``propagate``, ``maneuver`` (impulsive delta-V), ``lambert_transfer``
(solves for the impulsive delta-V that reaches a target position after a
given time of flight, via Basilisk's own ``lambertPlanner``/
``lambertSolver``/``lambertValidator`` chain, then applies it immediately
-- see ``engine.mission_engine``'s own docstring for exactly how),
``assignment``, ``report``, ``if``, ``while``, ``script_block``.
Targeting/optimization commands (GMAT's ``Target``/``Vary``/``Optimize``)
are explicitly NOT included -- interface design for those is future work,
not implemented here.

Collecting validation
----------------------
Unlike ``schema.scenario``'s existing ``validate()`` methods (raise on the
FIRST problem found, via ``_require`` -- preserved exactly as-is; nothing
in this module changes that), :meth:`Command.validate` returns a LIST of
every problem found in this command and its ``children`` subtree, each
prefixed with an item path -- the "report all errors at once, with item
paths" behavior requested for the mission-sequence layer specifically.
Cross-reference checks (does a ``"spacecraft"`` param actually name a real
spacecraft in this scenario?) are NOT done here -- exactly like
``DispersionConfig.validate()``/``PhasingKeepingConfig.validate()``
already don't check their own cross-references either, leaving that to
the scenario-level pass (see ``schema.validation.validate_all``) that has
the full spacecraft/ground-station name list to check against.
