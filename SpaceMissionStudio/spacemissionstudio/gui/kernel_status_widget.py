"""KernelStatusWidget: shows SPICE kernel fetch/cache status (see
``engine.kernels``) with a "Check / fetch kernels" button, satisfying the
"kernel management surfaced in the UI, not silently resolved in the
background" Phase 1 goal.

The actual check runs on a background ``QThread`` (see
``engine.kernels.ensure_kernels()``'s own docstring for why this
normally touches no network at all -- every ``packaging/`` installer
pre-fetches everything this app needs exactly once, during installation;
this widget's own fetch path only ever runs for real if that cache is
somehow missing/corrupted), so it never freezes the GUI either way.
Importing ``engine.kernels`` needs a Basilisk build; when it's missing,
this widget reports that clearly instead of crashing -- genuinely
exercised in this development sandbox (no Basilisk here), not just
handled in theory.
