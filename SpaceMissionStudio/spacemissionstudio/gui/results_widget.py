"""ResultsWidget: plots a :class:`engine.results.ResultSet` with Plotly,
embedded in a ``QWebEngineView`` -- replaces an earlier matplotlib
version, per explicit user request ("please rather use plotly, and not
matplotlib... make the plots visually more clear, professional and
appealing and informative") plus a real, separate complaint (matplotlib's
default axis formatting fell back to scientific/offset notation on
several series -- Plotly is configured below to never do that, on every
axis, regardless of data range). Takes a plain ``ResultSet`` -- no
Basilisk import in this module, so it's testable here with synthetic
data exactly like ``engine/results.py`` itself is.

``QWebEngineView``, not a static image: an embedded Plotly chart is a
real, interactive HTML/JS page (pan/zoom/box-select, a unified hover
tooltip showing every series' value at the cursor's x-position, a
built-in PNG-export button) -- a screenshot-style static render would
throw away exactly the interactivity that makes Plotly worth using over
matplotlib in the first place. ``plotly.js`` itself (~4.7 MB) is
referenced via a local ``file://`` src pointing directly at the copy
already installed as part of the ``plotly`` PyPI package's own
``package_data`` (:func:`_plotlyjs_path`) -- never a CDN reference (this
project avoids unnecessary network dependencies throughout, and a
SpaceMissionStudio desktop install has no reason to need one just to redraw a
plot), and never a second bundled copy of a multi-megabyte file this
project doesn't need to ship or keep in sync itself.

Running as root (this project's own CI/dev sandbox is; most real desktop
installs are not): Chromium refuses to start its renderer process as
root unless ``--no-sandbox`` is passed (a Chromium policy, not a Qt one
-- process sandboxing normally works by dropping privileges via setuid,
which is meaningless starting from an already-root process) -- confirmed
directly against a real ``QWebEngineView`` in this development sandbox,
which failed exactly that way without it. Handled below by setting
``QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS`` BEFORE ``PySide6.QtWebEngineWidgets`` is
imported (the only point at which QtWebEngine reads it) -- and ONLY when
actually running as root (``os.geteuid() == 0``), left off for a normal
non-root install, where Chromium's own process sandbox is real
defense-in-depth worth keeping even though this widget only ever loads
its own locally-generated HTML/JS, never remote or otherwise untrusted
content.

Verification status: the full local-``plotly.min.js``-via-``file://``
plus ``QWebEngineView.setHtml()`` pipeline was confirmed end-to-end in
this development sandbox (``QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`` -- no real
display here either) -- ``loadFinished`` fires ``True`` and a real
in-page JS check (``document.getElementsByClassName("plotly").length``)
confirms the chart div actually renders, not just that ``setHtml()``
didn't raise. The chosen design (re-send the FULL html, plotly.js
``<script src>`` reference included, on every redraw, rather than
loading the page shell once and pushing incremental updates via
``Plotly.react()`` through ``page().runJavaScript()``) was picked for
simplicity and testability (the built ``go.Figure`` object is directly
inspectable in a test, same role matplotlib's ``Axes`` used to play) --
NOT benchmarked against the incremental-update alternative for redraw
latency during a live (``set_live_result``) run; if that turns out to
feel sluggish on a real machine for a long/fast-updating run, the
incremental-update approach is the documented next step, not something
ruled out here.

Display choices below are all PLOT-only (``export_csv()``/``_on_export()``
keep writing exactly what ``TimeSeries`` holds -- raw SI units, elapsed
seconds -- since a CSV a user hands to another tool should stay
unambiguous, not follow a plot-only display preference):

* Per-category unit display (``_categorize()``, replacing an earlier
  blanket "every m/m-s series -> km/km-s" rule this project's own
  earlier version used): real user feedback was that the blanket rule
  went too far -- it converted the state vector (position/velocity) AND
  delta-V to km/km-s along with genuinely orbit-scale quantities like
  altitude and semi-major axis, but the explicit ask was the opposite
  for the first two ("delta-V shall always be displayed in m/s",
  "state vector elements shall be displayed in meters for position and
  m/s for velocity") while keeping it for the second two ("altitudes,
  semi-major axes shall be displayed in km"). Both can't be satisfied by
  one rule keyed on the literal unit string alone (position and
  semi-major axis are both recorded in plain "m"; velocity and delta-V
  are both plain "m/s") -- ``_categorize()`` keys off what each named
  series actually *is* instead (see its own docstring), with each
  category's own explicit unit choice, and only an uncategorized/future
  series (``_legacy_display()``) falls back to the old blanket rule.
  Orbital angle elements (inclination/RAAN/argument of periapsis/true
  anomaly, osculating and mean alike) additionally display in degrees,
  not Basilisk's native radians -- matching every angle INPUT field this
  app's own Scenario Editor already uses (e.g. ``inclination_deg``), and
  part of the same "convey more information" feedback that asked for
  titles/axis names/legends on every plot (see ``_categorize()``).
* The x-axis defaults to elapsed time (hours since the scenario epoch,
  as before) but can be switched to absolute epoch (UTC datetimes,
  ``series.time_s`` added to the epoch :meth:`set_result`/
  :meth:`set_live_result` were given) via ``x_axis_combo``. ``epoch_utc``
  is optional and defaults to ``None`` (falls back to elapsed time even
  if "Epoch (UTC)" is selected) so every existing caller/test that only
  ever passed a bare ``ResultSet`` keeps working unchanged.

        -png icon (``config={"displaylogo": False}`` above leaves it in;
        see this module's own docstring), but inside an embedded
        ``QWebEngineView`` that triggers Chromium's OWN download
        machinery, which this app never wires up

        rather than pulling in a server-side renderer (the ``kaleido``
        package) this project doesn't otherwise depend on -- consistent
        with this module's own "no unnecessary dependency" choice for
        ``plotly.js`` itself. ``scale: 2`` asks for a higher-than-screen
        -resolution render (sharper on a high-DPI display/print) at the
        chart's own current on-screen size, rather than a hardcoded
        width/height that might not match what's actually visible.

        ``Plotly.toImage()`` is asynchronous (it returns a ``Promise``).
        ``QWebEnginePage.runJavaScript()`` does NOT await a top-level
        returned ``Promise`` on this PySide6 version (confirmed directly,
        not assumed -- an earlier version of this method relied on that
        and silently got back an empty string every time, which looked
        exactly like a render failure but wasn't one), so this instead
        kicks the render off into a page-global variable and polls for it

        distinguishes "still rendering" from a real (possibly falsy)
        result, since a bare JS ``null``/``undefined`` also bridges back
        as an empty string here, not ``None`` as plain Python code might
