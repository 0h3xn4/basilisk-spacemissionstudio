"""Two small, reusable UX primitives, built once here and reused across
gui/ rather than re-invented per widget -- real user feedback ("make the
GUI more 'reactive'... the user always knows and understands what they
did. visual cues would help... currently, everything looks very raw and
unfinished"), and a follow-up survey of this app's own existing widgets
found the same two gaps repeating across most of them (add/remove
actions with no positive feedback beyond a list silently changing;
invalid input only ever caught by a blocking dialog at Save/Run time,
never at the specific field, at the moment it's typed):

* :func:`show_toast` -- a small, non-blocking, auto-dismissing
  notification, for "did my action actually do something" feedback on
  actions where a blocking ``QMessageBox`` would be overkill (Save, Add
  spacecraft, Remove sensor, ...) and a status-bar message alone is too
  easy to miss. That's not a guess: ``MainWindow.on_launch_vizard``'s own
  docstring already documents exactly this problem for ONE case (a
  status-bar message "easy to miss/get overwritten by the 'Running...'
  message that follows moments later") and had to be promoted to a
  one-time blocking dialog to be noticed at all -- a toast is the
  general-purpose fix that case shouldn't have needed a bespoke one-off
  dialog for.
* :func:`mark_invalid`/:func:`clear_invalid` -- inline, per-field
  validation feedback (a red border, via theme.py's own
  ``[state="error"]`` QSS rule, plus the reason as a tooltip), so a
  field the user is actively typing into can show it's wrong immediately
  rather than only at Save/Run time via a dialog that names the problem
  but not which of a dialog's many fields caused it.

Both are intentionally widget-library-free (no new PyPI dependency) --
plain ``QLabel``/dynamic-Qt-property mechanisms the Qt Style Sheets
system already documents, matching this project's own "no third-party
GUI-chrome dependency beyond PySide6 itself" precedent (see theme.py).
