"""Locating and launching the external Vizard application -- a separate,
non-Python Unity app (see ``docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst`` in
this checkout) that is NOT bundled with SpaceMissionStudio's own Python
package. This module only starts the standalone process and hands back a
way to tell whether it's still running; actually feeding it simulation
data (a playback ``.bin`` file or a live stream) is ``engine.vizard``'s
job, wired through ``SimulationService`` via
``gui.vizard_dialog.VizardRequest`` -- entirely separate from starting
the app itself.

**Closed-off/offline policy**: this module used to also offer an
automatic download of AVS's own pre-built Vizard binary
(``fetch_vizard()``, a background ``QThread`` fetch worker, and the
"Download Vizard" button that drove it from
``gui.main_window.MainWindow.on_launch_vizard``). That has been REMOVED
entirely (real user requirement -- "the app must be completely closed
off and offline, only exception is the installation process"; Vizard
itself is a separate, user-installed application, not something this
app's own install step can pre-fetch the way ``engine.kernels`` does for
SPICE/support data). Install Vizard yourself from
``docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst``'s published links, then use
``remember_vizard_executable``'s own manual browse prompt (surfaced by
``gui.main_window.MainWindow.on_launch_vizard`` when it can't be found
automatically) to point this app at it once.

Vizard's own download instructions say only "install the program in the
typical Applications folder or Desktop" -- there's no single guaranteed
install path, so :func:`find_vizard_executable` is inherently best
-effort: it checks a remembered path from a previous
:func:`remember_vizard_executable` call first (an exact answer the user
already gave us), then falls back to guessing a small set of common
per-OS install locations, and returns ``None`` if neither turns up
anything.
