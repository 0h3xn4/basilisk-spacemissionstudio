"""Locating, fetching, and launching the external Vizard application -- a
separate, non-Python Unity app (see ``docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst``
in this checkout) that is NOT bundled with SpaceMissionStudio's own Python
package. This module only starts the standalone process and hands back a
way to tell whether it's still running; actually feeding it simulation
data (a playback ``.bin`` file or a live stream) is ``engine.vizard``'s
job, wired through ``SimulationService`` via
``gui.vizard_dialog.VizardRequest`` -- entirely separate from starting
the app itself.

**Closed-off/offline policy**: SpaceMissionStudio never accesses the
network implicitly at runtime (real user requirement -- "the app must be
completely closed off and offline, only exception is the installation
process"). A later, explicit user decision relaxed that to also allow "a
one-time fetch during each startup of the app, to store everything that
is needed locally so it can be used later again" -- but ONLY after
asking the user first, never automatically. :func:`fetch_vizard` is that
kind of fetch: it is NEVER called automatically -- its only two callers
are both gated behind an explicit user click: the "Download Vizard"
button in ``gui.main_window.MainWindow``'s "Vizard not found" dialog
(ad hoc, whenever Launch Vizard can't find it), and nothing else. It
downloads AVS's own published pre-built binary for this platform -- the
exact same ``Vizard_<platform>.zip`` links
``docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst`` already points a human to,
just fetched automatically instead -- and caches the extracted result
locally (:data:`DEFAULT_FETCH_DIR`), so once fetched, launching Vizard
again needs no further network access; :func:`remember_vizard_executable`
persists the resolved path so even :func:`find_vizard_executable` doesn't
need to re-search for it next time.

A true single build step isn't realistic (Vizard's own repository has no
scripted/CLI build path at all -- only an interactive Unity Editor GUI
workflow, checked directly, not assumed) and the two are deliberately
separate PROCESSES at runtime regardless (Vizard can play back a saved
``.bin`` file with zero Basilisk involvement). What IS realistic, and
what :func:`fetch_vizard` does: skip building Vizard from source entirely
by downloading AVS's own pre-built binary instead.

Vizard's own download instructions say only "install the program in the
typical Applications folder or Desktop" -- there's no single guaranteed
install path, so :func:`find_vizard_executable` is inherently best
-effort: it checks a remembered path from a previous
:func:`remember_vizard_executable` call first (an exact answer the user
already gave us), then falls back to guessing a small set of common
per-OS install locations, and returns ``None`` if neither turns up
anything -- at which point the caller (``gui.main_window.MainWindow
.on_launch_vizard``) offers :func:`fetch_vizard` (automatic download, on
an explicit click) or a manual browse prompt.
