"""RunWorker/MonteCarloWorker: run :class:`engine.service.SimulationService`/
:func:`engine.monte_carlo.run_monte_carlo` on a background ``QThread`` so a
(potentially long) propagation or batch never freezes the GUI's event
loop. Importing ``engine.service``/``engine.monte_carlo`` needs a
Basilisk build; when it's missing, each worker reports that clearly via
its own ``failed`` signal -- there is only one error-reporting path for
the caller (``MainWindow``) to handle per worker, whether the problem is
"no Basilisk", a bad scenario, or a Basilisk-internal error.

``RunWorker.run()`` dispatches on ``scenario.mission_sequence`` exactly
like ``cli.py``'s ``cmd_run()`` does: a non-empty sequence runs through
``engine.mission_engine.MissionEngine`` instead of
``SimulationService.run()``/``run_live()`` directly, and ``finished_ok``
always carries both the :class:`engine.results.ResultSet` and (when a
``mission_sequence`` ran) its :class:`engine.results.CommandSummary`, or
``None`` for the summary otherwise.

**Abort a running simulation** (direct user feedback: "there should be
an option to abort a running simulation, if needed, without breaking
the tool"): :meth:`RunWorker.request_cancel` sets a
:class:`threading.Event`, checked cooperatively between simulation
chunks (``SimulationService.run_live``'s ``should_cancel``) or between
mission_sequence commands (``MissionEngine``'s ``should_cancel``) --
never via ``QThread.terminate()`` or any other forced kill, which could
leave Basilisk's C++ simulation state mid-mutation and is exactly the
kind of "breaking the tool" this was asked to avoid. Cancellation
therefore always takes effect at the next such checkpoint, not
instantly (there is no hook into the middle of a single
``ExecuteSimulation()`` call -- see both ``should_cancel`` docstrings),
and a cancelled run reports the ``cancelled`` signal with whatever
partial ``ResultSet``/``CommandSummary`` had been produced so far,
rather than silently discarding it.

The non-mission_sequence path now ALWAYS runs through
``SimulationService.run_live()`` (never the plain, non-chunked
``run()``), specifically so it's always cancellable regardless of the
"Live Plot" toggle -- ``self.live`` now only controls whether
``progress`` is actually emitted (i.e. whether the plot redraws as it
goes), not whether the run is chunked at all. ``run_live()``'s own
docstring already notes ``_LIVE_DEFAULT_FRAMES`` (60) bounds this to a
small, fixed number of extra ``ExecuteSimulation()`` calls regardless
of run length -- negligible next to the actual simulated work, so this
applies with no live plot watching just as safely as with one.
