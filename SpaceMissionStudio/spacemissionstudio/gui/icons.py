"""The application icon -- drawn procedurally with :class:`QPainter`
(a satellite glyph: a gold body between two blue solar panels, plus an
antenna at larger sizes, matching ``theme.py``'s accent color for the
panels) rather than shipped as a bitmap asset, so there is no binary
file to keep in sync with the theme and no new packaging step
(``packaging/build_wheel.sh``/the installer's ``.desktop`` entry already
just point at whatever :func:`app_icon`/:func:`window_icon_path`
produce). Used as both the ``QApplication``/``QMainWindow`` window icon
(see ``app.py``) and, cached to a PNG on disk, the ``.desktop`` entry's
``Icon=`` target (see ``packaging/``) -- a ``.desktop`` file needs a
real file path, not an in-memory ``QIcon``.

Real user feedback, with a rendered side-by-side comparison, on the
FIRST design this module drew (a dark central body inside a thin
inclined orbit ellipse, with a small dot on the ring): "refine it to
read clearer at small sizes" -- at 16-32px (window titlebar/taskbar,
where this icon is actually seen most) it read as a cartoon eye, not
an orbit. Root cause, confirmed by rendering variants and comparing
them side by side rather than guessing: "a filled circle centered
inside a surrounding ring" is essentially the universal flat-icon glyph
for an eye (pupil + iris), and no amount of stroke-width/dot-size
tuning on that same structure fixed it -- several tuning passes made it
read MORE eye-like, not less (a bigger, lighter dot became an
eye-catchlight). Fixing it needed a structurally different silhouette,
not parameter tweaks on the same one.

Replaced with an angular satellite glyph (body + two solar-panel
wings), which stays legible at every size tested (256 down to 16px)
specifically because it has no closed ring-around-a-disc shape to be
mistaken for an eye, and reads clearly as spacecraft hardware instead --
also a better thematic fit for a *mission-analysis* tool than a single
orbit-and-dot, which only depicts one specific orbit rather than the
domain generally. The body's gold color is not arbitrary: real
satellites commonly use gold-foil (multi-layer insulation) thermal
blankets, so a gold body next to blue solar panels is representationally
accurate, not just decorative -- and it was ALSO found (by rendering the
icon against both light and dark backgrounds, not assumed) to be the
fix for a real contrast bug the first gold-free attempt had: this
module's original near-black body color is nearly invisible against a
dark-mode taskbar, where a gold body stays clearly visible against both
light and dark surfaces.
