A standalone, GUI-based mission-analysis application for Linux and
Windows 11, using the Basilisk astrodynamics framework (AVS Lab,
University of Colorado Boulder) as its sole simulation/dynamics engine.
Think "STK/FreeFlyer-lite" -- every capability maps to a specific
Basilisk module, or is explicitly flagged as custom/out-of-scope, never
fabricated.

**Status: v2.0.0**. See "Version 2.0.0" below for what's new in this
release, "Capabilities" for the full current feature set, and
[`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md) for the full phase-by-phase development log
this README used to carry inline (every feature's design rationale, every
bug found and fixed, the full crash-investigation writeups) -- nothing
was deleted, it just moved out of the way of a README someone installing
this for the first time should actually be able to read.

**New to SpaceMissionStudio?** This README is the technical reference (install,
architecture, verification status). For a beginner-friendly, step-by-step
walkthrough of actually *using* the app -- no programming background
assumed -- see [`USER_MANUAL.md`](USER_MANUAL.md).

## Getting started

**Just want to use the app, not develop it?** There's a real installer
for that -- no terminal, no typed `pip`/`venv` commands:

* **Linux:** `packaging/build_deb.sh` produces `spacemissionstudio_2.0.0_all.deb`
  -- install it with `sudo apt install ./spacemissionstudio_2.0.0_all.deb`
  (or double-click it in a file manager with package-install support) and
  get a normal application-menu entry. The build itself (this exact
  version string included) was re-run in this project's own development
  sandbox for the 2.0.0 release and produces a valid `.deb` with
  `dpkg-deb`; the full real-Basilisk end-to-end install (venv creation,
  `bsk[all]` from PyPI, a real `printBuildInfo()`) was confirmed at
  1.0.0 against the same install logic, which 2.0.0 carries forward
  unchanged (just under the renamed package/launcher -- see "Version
  2.0.0" below) -- see `packaging/README.md`'s "The real installers"
  section for exactly what that confirmed and when.
* **Windows:** `packaging/windows/spacemissionstudio.iss` (built with
  [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)) produces
  `spacemissionstudio-2.0.0-setup.exe` -- a normal installer wizard, ending in
  a Start Menu entry. New for 1.0.0; written carefully but still not run
  on a real Windows machine (this development sandbox has none) -- see
  `packaging/README.md` for the same honesty-first verification status
  this project applies everywhere else.

Either way, the installer still needs internet access the first time (to
download Basilisk from PyPI) -- there's no getting around that without
bundling a multi-hundred-MB Basilisk wheel directly into the installer,
which neither one does yet (see `packaging/README.md`'s "vendoring
decision" section).

**Developing SpaceMissionStudio, or want full control over the install?**
Everything below was actually run, not just written and assumed to work
-- including step 2, which for most of this project's history looked
like it would need a from-source Basilisk build (fragile, and blocked in
this project's own sandbox). It turned out Basilisk now publishes a
prebuilt wheel to PyPI, and installing it that way genuinely works.

**1. Prerequisites**

* Linux or Windows 11, Python 3.9+. Basilisk's own prebuilt-wheel support
  matrix (`../docs/source/Install.rst`) explicitly covers both: "Windows:
  Windows 10/11 (x86_64)" and "Linux: Manylinux 2.24+ (x86_64, aarch64)"
  -- macOS is also listed there but not a target for SpaceMissionStudio's own
  install scripts below (nothing prevents `pip install` from working on
  it too, just not independently verified for this project).
* `python -m venv` (or your preferred environment tool) -- everything
  below assumes a virtualenv so it doesn't touch your system Python.
  (Linux commands below use `python3`/`pip3`-equivalent `python`/`pip`
  once the venv is active, matching what actually ran in this project's
  own Linux development sandbox; on Windows, use the `python`/`pip`
  installed by the official python.org or Microsoft Store installer.)

**2. Install Basilisk**

Linux/macOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "bsk[all]"
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install "bsk[all]"
```

This is Basilisk's own recommended install path (see `../docs/source/Install.rst`
in this checkout) -- a prebuilt wheel from PyPI, no compiler or Conan
required, published for both platforms above. The Linux command was
genuinely run in this project's development sandbox: the wheel downloads
and installs cleanly, and every Basilisk module/class this app's code
imports (across every phase) was confirmed present. The Windows command
was not independently run in this project (this development sandbox is
Linux-only) -- it follows Basilisk's own documented Windows install path
exactly, but is flagged here rather than claimed as verified end-to-end;
please report any issues. Building from source is still possible and
documented (`../docs/source/Build.rst`) if you need an unpublished
feature or a locally-modified Basilisk, but it's no longer the first
thing to reach for on either platform.

**3. Install SpaceMissionStudio**

```bash
cd SpaceMissionStudio
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

(Same command on Windows, once the venv above is active.)

(Or skip steps 2-3 and run `packaging/install.sh --basilisk-wheel "bsk[all]"`
on Linux, or `packaging/install.ps1 -BasiliskWheel "bsk[all]"` on Windows,
instead -- either does both in one shot into its own private venv and
adds a launcher (a desktop entry on Linux, a Start Menu shortcut on
Windows) -- see `packaging/README.md` for exactly what's verified on
each platform. The Linux script and its `--basilisk-wheel` flag
genuinely work, for the same reason step 2 does; the Windows script is
new for the 1.0.0 release and carries the same not-independently-run
caveat as the Windows command above.)

**4. Check it's working**

```bash
spacemissionstudio kernels-status
```

The first time you run anything that touches SPICE (this command, `run`,
or the GUI's Run menu), Basilisk downloads a handful of standard SPICE
kernels (leap-seconds, planetary ephemeris, ~100 MB total) from NAIF and
caches them locally -- this needs working internet access to
`naif.jpl.nasa.gov` once. `kernels-status` reports exactly which kernels
are missing/cached and why, rather than failing silently deep inside a
run.

**5. Run something**

```bash
spacemissionstudio validate spacemissionstudio/scenarios/two_body_validation.json
spacemissionstudio run spacemissionstudio/scenarios/two_body_validation.json --out-dir results/
```

or launch the GUI:

```bash
spacemissionstudio gui
```

File > Open the same scenario, or build one from scratch (spacecraft,
sensors, actuators, FSW mode, ground stations, Monte Carlo dispersions --
all editable live with validation feedback), then Run > Run Simulation.

**If something doesn't work**, "Verification status" right below says
exactly what has and hasn't been confirmed against a real Basilisk
build (short version: everything has, including a real multi-day run)
-- read it before assuming a failure is a bug rather than a local
environment issue.

## Verification status

* **Everything Basilisk-independent** (`spacemissionstudio/schema/`,
  `engine/spaceweather.py`, `engine/results.py`, `engine/link_budget.py`,
  `engine/constellation.py`, `engine/spacecraft_templates.py`,
  `engine/propellant_bookkeeping.py`, `engine/time_system.py`,
  `engine/orbit_design.py`, `engine/scenario_explainer.py`, `cli.py`, and
  the entire `spacemissionstudio/gui/` package) has no Basilisk import
  and is fully exercised either way -- `pytest tests/` runs and passes
  1305 tests without Basilisk installed (see "Running the tests" below).
  That includes the PySide6 GUI: built, run headless, and driven with
  `pytest-qt` for real -- every form field, every menu action, every
  dialog -- not asserted about in the abstract.
* **Everything Basilisk-dependent** (`kernels.py`,
  `service.py`, `fsw.py`/`vizard.py`, `monte_carlo.py`,
  `orbit_maintenance.py`, `mission_engine.py`) has been confirmed
  against a real `pip install "bsk[all]"` Basilisk build, including a
  **real, full multi-day end-to-end run**: a real user ran the
  `05_formation_flying_phasing.json` template (station-keeping +
  phasing-keeping + live Vizard streaming, both active on the same
  spacecraft) to 100% completion -- the full 7 simulated days, no
  errors. Getting there involved finding and fixing a real,
  previously-unreproducible crash (root-caused with a real `gdb`
  session down to a dangling-pointer bug in `engine/vizard.py`'s Vizard
  live-data panels -- full story in `HISTORY.md`).
* **This development sandbox** (where most of this project's code was
  written) has no route to the NAIF SPICE kernel host, so a handful of
  things could only be confirmed correct up to that point here, not run
  end-to-end in-sandbox -- not a project limitation, just this one
  sandbox's own network policy. Anything with that specific gap says so
  in its own docstring/module comment.
* **Packaging.** The scriptable install path
  (`packaging/build_wheel.sh`/`install.sh`, including the
  Basilisk-wheel-vendoring path) AND the real, double-click Linux
  installer (`packaging/build_deb.sh`'s `.deb` package) were both fully
  verified end-to-end on Linux -- a real Basilisk build installed for
  real, confirmed with its own `printBuildInfo()`, and hundreds of this
  project's own Basilisk-dependent tests genuinely passing against it
  (not auto-skipping) when run from the installed copy. Their Windows
  counterparts (`build_wheel.ps1`/`install.ps1`, and the Inno Setup
  installer `packaging/windows/spacemissionstudio.iss`, all new for 1.0.0)
  were written against the same already-verified logic and Basilisk's
  own documented Windows install path, but have not been run on a real
  Windows 11 machine (none has ever been available in this development
  sandbox) -- see `packaging/README.md` for exactly what's verified
  where, and please report anything that doesn't work as documented.
  That end-to-end packaging pass predates `results_widget.py`'s
  matplotlib-to-Plotly migration (see the "GUI & CLI" bullet under
  "Capabilities" below): the plots now render inside a `QWebEngineView`,
  which -- unlike plain PySide6 widgets, matplotlib included -- embeds a
  full Chromium renderer with its own system-library footprint (things
  like `libnss3`/`libatk-bridge2.0-0`/`libgbm1`, beyond the
  `libegl1`/`libopengl0`/`libxcb-cursor0` already called out below for
  plain PySide6). This development sandbox's container already had
  everything `QtWebEngineProcess` needs (confirmed with `ldd` --
  nothing reported missing) and the full headless `pytest-qt` suite
  exercises real `QWebEngineView` instances, but that is not the same
  as confirming a fresh install on a minimal target machine (the `.deb`
  postinst's or the Windows installer's own actual end user); if
  `spacemissionstudio gui` starts but the results plot stays blank, that is
  the first thing to check. Unrelated to that migration: `build_deb.sh`
  itself was re-run for the 2.0.0 release and still produces a valid,
  installable `spacemissionstudio_2.0.0_all.deb` via `dpkg-deb` (it reads
  `spacemissionstudio.__version__` rather than hardcoding a version string),
  but the full real-Basilisk install chain this paragraph describes was
  not independently re-run against that specific 2.0.0 artifact -- only
  the unchanged underlying install logic has been.

## Capabilities

What's actually implemented, grouped by concern (full design rationale
and the order each landed in: `HISTORY.md`).

**Scenario model & data** -- a versioned, human-readable JSON format
(spacecraft, orbit ICs in three forms -- classical elements with true or
mean anomaly, Cartesian, TLE --, gravity, ground stations, space
weather, sim settings, Monte Carlo dispersions, a GMAT/FreeFlyer-style
**Mission Sequence**), hand-written validation with specific error
messages, a schema-migration registry, and reference-integrity checking
(rename a spacecraft and every reference to it updates atomically;
deleting one that's still referenced is refused, listing exactly what
references it). No third-party schema library.

**Orbital dynamics & propagation** -- central-body point-mass or Earth
spherical-harmonics gravity plus third-body point-mass perturbers,
atmospheric drag (Earth-only; a choice of NRLMSISE-00 or a simple
exponential model -- see `SpaceWeatherConfig.atmosphere_model`'s own
docstring for why not Jacchia-Roberts too: Basilisk has no such model)
and SRP (per spacecraft, on that spacecraft's own "Orbit / mass" tab),
a selectable integrator (`euler`/`rk2`/`rkf45`/`rkf78`), and osculating
Keplerian elements computed and exported alongside inertial
position/velocity at every sample -- plus, when a real J2 term is
actually modeled (Earth with spherical-harmonics degree >= 2), MEAN
(first-order-J2, osc -> mean) elements alongside the osculating ones,
via Basilisk's own `orbitalMotion.clMeanOscMap` (the same tool its
`meanOEFeedback` FSW module uses -- not a bespoke implementation).
NRLMSISE-00 drag can also use a
CONSERVATIVE, sustained-worst-case margin (a chosen percentile -- e.g.
95th -- of REAL historical F10.7/Ap data YOU supply as a local file,
held constant across the whole scenario, never a fabricated number)
instead of ordinary resolved space weather -- see
`engine/spaceweather.py`'s own docstring, "Conservative ('worst-case')
drag margin". SpaceMissionStudio makes no network calls at runtime (see
"Closed-off/offline policy" below), so this app can no longer fetch that
historical data itself; download a CelesTrak CSV yourself, outside this
app, and point `local_file_path` at it.

**Attitude, sensors & actuators** -- every `fsw_mode` maps to a real
Basilisk FSW module chain (attitude nav/guidance/control), idealized or
real reaction-wheel actuation, and star tracker/IMU/coarse-sun-sensor/
magnetometer sensors (magnetometer is Earth-only). A `"thermal"` sensor
(`sensorThermal.SensorThermal`) models the real temperature of any
flat-plate component -- radiative absorption/emission driven by the
actual simulated attitude and (when shared with a power/eclipse-aware
spacecraft) real eclipse state, plus an optional internal power draw --
with its own measurement noise/bias/fault layer
(`tempMeasurement.TempMeasurement`). `"reaction_wheel"` actuators
separately gain an OPTIONAL per-wheel motor-thermal model
(`motorThermal.MotorThermal`, motor inefficiency/friction heat vs.
ambient dissipation) via the `motor_thermal_*` params. See template '20'.

**Mission planning** -- a GMAT/FreeFlyer-inspired Resources / Mission
Sequence / Output architecture: `propagate` (duration, epoch, or
periapsis/apoapsis-event stop conditions), `maneuver` (impulsive
delta-V, inertial/VNB/RTN), `lambert_transfer` (solves for the
impulsive delta-V that reaches a target position after a given time of
flight, via Basilisk's own `lambertPlanner`/`lambertSolver`/
`lambertValidator`), `assignment`, `report`, `if`/`while`
conditionals, and `script_block` commands, run by a real execution
engine (`engine.mission_engine.MissionEngine`) with a dedicated GUI
editor and output console.

**Mission analysis** -- ground-station access analysis (has-access,
slant range, elevation, azimuth per station/spacecraft pair), a real
power budget (solar panel/battery/eclipse, driven by actual simulated
attitude and eclipse state, not a flat duty cycle), a downlink RF
link-margin estimate evaluated against real simulated slant range, and
Monte Carlo batch analysis (`Basilisk.utilities.MonteCarlo`, dry-mass
and attitude dispersions).

**Automatic Sun-pointing / ground-station-pointing attitude switching** --
`SpacecraftConfig.comms_pointing` (`engine.fsw.build_comms_pointing`): a
small arbitrator `SysModel` that holds a spacecraft Sun-pointing (for
solar-panel power generation) by default, and switches it to point a
body-fixed antenna boresight at a named ground station instead, entirely
driven by that station's own REAL `groundLocation.GroundLocation` access
state -- never a manually-specified time window. Only the attitude
REFERENCE switches; the spacecraft's own integrated attitude state is
untouched, so the existing closed-loop `mrpFeedback` controller physically
slews across the transition rather than snapping instantly. An optional
`comms_power_w` draws extra battery power only while actually
ground-station-pointing, and `RFLinkConfig.antenna_beamwidth_deg` (when
set) feeds the spacecraft's own, actually-achieved pointing error into
`engine.link_budget`'s margin calculation as a parabolic-pattern
antenna-pointing-loss term -- so the link margin, gated on both real
access AND the spacecraft having actually switched modes, can show a
real "geometrically visible but not yet actually linked" period right at
each transition. See template '19' (below).

**Orbit maintenance** -- altitude/semi-major-axis station-keeping and
constellation-wide phasing maintenance, both with real delta-V/
propellant bookkeeping (rocket-equation mass depletion fed back into
simulated spacecraft mass every tick) and eclipse-gated burns; a
constant-frame (VNB/RTN) continuous-thrust maneuver mode; a
Walker-pattern constellation generator (satellite count, planes,
phasing factor, altitude, inclination -> a full set of spacecraft with
pre-computed orbital elements); a **Generate phasing formation...**
wizard (`engine.formation`) that turns an existing chief spacecraft plus
a desired Radial/Transverse/Normal (Hill-frame) offset at epoch into a
new follower spacecraft with `phasing_keeping`/`station_keeping`
pre-wired -- the along-track (T) component becomes the actively-held
separation target; radial/cross-track (R/N) only set the follower's
starting geometry, since the phasing controller has no radial/
cross-track control authority (the wizard says so up front).

**Fuel tank** -- real propellant depletion for `"thruster"` actuators
(`SpacecraftConfig.fuel_tank`, `engine.fsw.build_fuel_tank`): Basilisk's
own `fuelTank` state effector (`FuelTankModelUniformBurn`), tied to the
thruster hardware so it reads the SAME mass-flow rate the thruster
itself already computes (`mDot = F / (steadyIsp * g0)`) -- a materially
different, more physical mechanism than the orbit-maintenance
bookkeeping above (which is a hand-rolled Python estimate specific to
station-keeping/phasing/constant-thrust burns); this one is Basilisk's
own effector, including the resulting center-of-mass shift as
propellant depletes.

**Vizard visualization** -- live-stream or `.bin` playback file, an
Earth-centered default camera view with orbit trace lines, live
data panels (battery charge, station-keeping propellant remaining,
delta-V used -- station-keeping and phasing-keeping reported as separate
panels, since both draw from one shared tank -- for a phasing formation,
the real chief/follower offset broken out into Radial/Transverse/Normal
panels (the same R/T/N terms the phasing-formation wizard itself uses,
not an abstract single number), ground-station access-window indicators,
and -- for a `comms_pointing` spacecraft -- a pointing-error bar plus
"Mode"/"Link status" badges mirroring the Mission Dashboard's own live
GUI telemetry -- all driven by real, already-simulated values, not
static snapshots, with Vizard's own native live current/max readout on
every panel), custom 3D models per spacecraft (purely cosmetic), and a **Launch
Vizard** action that starts the external application itself (offering
to download AVS's own pre-built binary automatically if none can be
found -- see "Running the CLI" above), not just configures what feeds
it.

**Reusable starting points** -- three spacecraft "bus" templates
(passive CubeSat, 3-axis-stabilized CubeSat, ESPA-class smallsat) and
twenty complete example scenarios, eighteen covering one major concept
each in isolation plus two integrated demonstrations (see "Template
missions" below).

**Safe cancellation** -- **Abort Simulation** cooperatively cancels an
in-progress run (or Monte Carlo batch, or Mission Sequence) between
simulation chunks or commands, keeping whatever partial results were
already produced -- never a forced kill that could leave Basilisk's C++
state mid-mutation.

**GUI & CLI** -- a full PySide6 desktop shell (scenario editor,
Monte Carlo, live progress feedback, a real visual theme/icon/
toolbar) and an equivalent headless CLI (`spacemissionstudio validate/run/
monte-carlo/kernels-status/generate-constellation/gui`), both built on
the exact same `schema`/`engine` layer -- neither is a thin wrapper
around the other. Result plots are Plotly figures (a validated,
colorblind-safe categorical palette; a unified hover tooltip; plain
decimal axis ticks -- never matplotlib's scientific/offset notation)
rendered in an embedded `QWebEngineView`, with the epoch/elapsed-time
x-axis toggle and per-series km-unit conversion described above still
applying unchanged; see `results_widget.py`'s own module docstring for
why `QWebEngineView` over a static image, and "Verification status"
above for this migration's one open packaging caveat. A "Mission
Dashboard" tab (`mission_dashboard_widget.py`) shows the same live run
as a set of grouped status readouts (operating state, attitude, power,
RF link) instead of a plot, for a `comms_pointing`-configured
spacecraft -- fed from the exact same `RunWorker.progress`/
`finished_ok`/`cancelled` signals the Results tab already uses, so it
updates live during a run with no extra plumbing.

## Running the tests

```bash
cd SpaceMissionStudio
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The suite has 1826 tests. Without Basilisk on `PYTHONPATH`, 1591 of
them run and pass (schema, space weather, results, link budget,
constellation generation, CLI, and the full PySide6 GUI, run headless),
and the 235 that need a real Basilisk build (marked `requires_basilisk`,
or skipped on a Basilisk-availability check, per `tests/conftest.py`)
are skipped.

With Basilisk installed (`pip install "bsk[all]"` -- see "Getting
started" above), those tests run for real: 1599 pass and 11 skip (the
ones whose premise is specifically "Basilisk is unavailable"). The
first run needs internet access once, so Basilisk can download its
SPICE ephemeris kernels; without them, the ~45 kernel-dependent tests
fail with `KernelError`.
`pip install pytest-xdist` and `pytest tests/ -n auto` runs the suite
on all CPU cores.
See "Verification status" above for how thoroughly that's actually been
exercised -- short version: yes, including a real full multi-day run.

`packaging/build_wheel.sh`/`install.sh` are NOT run by `pytest` (they're
shell scripts that build/install a real wheel, not something worth
wrapping in a slow subprocess-spawning test) -- see `packaging/README.md`
for how they were verified instead.

If PySide6 fails to import with `ImportError: libEGL.so.1: cannot open
shared object file` (a minimal Linux install, or a container like the one
this session used), install the missing system libraries first --
Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install libegl1 libopengl0 libxcb-cursor0` (this
session also needed `libgl1`/`libxkbcommon0`, but those were already
present on the base image; a truly minimal system may need them too).

## Using the schema/space-weather layer standalone (no Basilisk needed)

```python
from spacemissionstudio.schema import Scenario, GravityConfig, OrbitIC, SpacecraftConfig

scenario = Scenario(
    name="demo",
    epoch_utc="2030-01-01T00:00:00",
    gravity=GravityConfig(central_body="earth", central_body_degree=0),
    spacecraft=[
        SpacecraftConfig(
            name="sat-1",
            orbit=OrbitIC(type="classical_elements", semi_major_axis_km=7000.0,
                          eccentricity=0.001, inclination_deg=51.6, raan_deg=0.0,
                          arg_periapsis_deg=0.0, true_anomaly_deg=0.0),
        )
    ],
)
scenario.validate()
scenario.save("my_scenario.json")
```

```python
from datetime import datetime
from spacemissionstudio.engine import spaceweather as sw

# resolve() itself never touches the network -- "celestrak" is not a
# valid source. Use "local_file" with your own downloaded CSV (or one
# fetched via the GUI's startup prompt -- see sw.fetch()/
# sw.cached_fetch_path(), both consent-gated, never automatic), or
# "synthetic" (the default) for a locally-generated, solar-cycle-shaped
# profile that needs no file at all.
resolved = sw.resolve("local_file", datetime(2030, 1, 1), datetime(2030, 4, 1),
                       local_file_path="/path/to/your/SW-All.csv")  # your own CelesTrak download
print(resolved.path, resolved.is_synthetic, resolved.warnings)
```

## Running a scenario (requires a Basilisk build)

```python
from spacemissionstudio.schema import load_scenario
from spacemissionstudio.engine.service import SimulationService

scenario = load_scenario("spacemissionstudio/scenarios/two_body_validation.json")
service = SimulationService(scenario)
result = service.run()
result.export_csv("out/")
```

To also get attitude control and a Vizard playback file, set a
spacecraft's `fsw_mode`/`sensors`/`actuators` (see `engine/fsw.py`) and
pass a `VizardRequest`:

```python
from spacemissionstudio.engine.vizard import VizardRequest

service = SimulationService(scenario, vizard_request=VizardRequest(save_file="out/viz.bin"))
result = service.run()
```

## Running the CLI

The `spacemissionstudio` command (installed by `pip install -e .`; `python3 -m
spacemissionstudio.cli` works identically without installing) is the
batch/headless entry point, built on exactly the calls above -- see
`cli.py`'s own docstring.

```bash
# no Basilisk needed:
spacemissionstudio validate spacemissionstudio/scenarios/two_body_validation.json
spacemissionstudio spaceweather-resolve spacemissionstudio/scenarios/two_body_validation.json

# needs a Basilisk build:
spacemissionstudio run spacemissionstudio/scenarios/two_body_validation.json --out-dir results/
spacemissionstudio run scenario_with_fsw.json --out-dir results/ --vizard-save-file results/viz.bin
spacemissionstudio monte-carlo scenario_with_dispersions.json --archive-dir mc_results/
spacemissionstudio kernels-status

# launches the PySide6 GUI (needs the 'gui' extra; does NOT need Basilisk
# to open -- only Run/Check Kernels need it, and report clearly if it's
# missing rather than crashing):
spacemissionstudio gui
```

Without Basilisk, `run` and `kernels-status` print a specific "Basilisk is
not installed/built" message and exit with status 2 -- genuinely
verified, not just designed to behave that way.

Two more commands worth knowing: **Launch Vizard** (Run menu/toolbar,
GUI only) starts the external Vizard application itself, separate from
configuring how a run feeds it -- if it can't be found automatically
(a remembered path, or a short list of common per-OS install
locations), a dialog offers **Download Vizard** (fetches AVS's own
pre-built binary for your platform, cached locally -- an explicit click,
never automatic; see "Closed-off/offline policy" below) alongside the
original **Browse...** for an existing install (see
`docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst` in the Basilisk checkout for the
same published links, if you'd rather install it yourself);
**Abort Simulation** (Run menu, GUI only, also while
a Monte Carlo batch or Mission Sequence is running) cooperatively
cancels an in-progress run between simulation chunks or
mission-sequence commands -- never a forced kill, so partial results
from before the cancellation are kept, not discarded. Full detail on
both in `HISTORY.md`.

## Running the GUI

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
spacemissionstudio gui
# or: python3 -m spacemissionstudio.gui.app
```

The GUI opens on its **Load Scenario** tab (left pane) -- pick one of the
twenty built-in template missions (see "Template missions" below) or
browse for any other scenario file; either one switches you to the
**Scenario Editor** tab next to it with that scenario loaded and ready to
edit. Every row of the template list carries its own **Customize...**
button (always enabled, no selection needed; its accessible name is
"Customize: \<template name\>"): a short, multi-step walkthrough of just that template's own key
tunable parameters (pre-filled with its current values), ending in the
same Scenario Editor tab with those changes already applied -- a faster
path than the full editor form for someone who wants "GEO
station-keeping, but with a tighter deadband and twice the propellant"
rather than every field on every spacecraft. The
original template file is never modified either way (both still need
File > Save As to write anywhere). File > New/Open/Save/Save As work against the same
`schema.Scenario`/`load_scenario()`/`.save()` the CLI uses (File > Open
and the Load Scenario tab's own "Browse for a file..." button are two
paths to the same `open_path()`); the scenario form's validation status
label updates live as you type, including its Monte Carlo section
(enable/num_runs/thread_count + a dispersion list, referencing spacecraft
by name). Run > Run Simulation runs `SimulationService` on a background
thread (the UI stays responsive) and switches to the Results tab when
done, with a plot per result series, a CSV export button (every series
at once), and "Save PNG..."/"Save SVG..." buttons (just the currently
displayed plot, to a user-chosen location via a native Save As dialog --
rendered client-side through the same `plotly.js` already on the page,
not a new `kaleido` dependency). A
**"Mission Dashboard"** tab alongside Results shows the same run's live,
at-a-glance telemetry (sim time/mode/ground-station visibility, pointing
error/tracking status, battery charge-SOC-net power, and a live RF
link-budget breakdown) whenever the scenario has a
`comms_pointing`-configured spacecraft (see template '19'); it stays on
its own empty-state placeholder otherwise. Run > Check
Kernels shows SPICE kernel fetch/cache status. Both Run actions report a
clear error (not a crash) if Basilisk isn't installed/built.

## Template missions for learning and for starting your own

`spacemissionstudio/scenarios/templates/` has twenty ready-to-run scenario
files, each demonstrating one SpaceMissionStudio concept in isolation (except
the last two, which deliberately integrate several) --
two-body orbits, J2/third-body perturbations, GEO station-keeping,
a generated Walker constellation, formation-flying phasing control,
attitude pointing (idealized, then with real ADCS hardware), a Mission
Sequence-based impulsive orbit raise, a Monte Carlo dispersion
analysis, uncontrolled gravity-gradient torque, thruster-only attitude
control, reaction-wheel momentum management via thrusters or via
magnetic torque rods, real sun-heading estimation from coarse sun
sensor hardware, direct celestial-body pointing, a Lambert-solver
point-to-point transfer, real propellant depletion via a fuel tank,
drag-driven LEO station-keeping (the direct LEO counterpart to
GEO station-keeping above), an integrated Sun-pointing/ground
-station-pointing spacecraft with a live power budget and RF link
margin, automatically switching attitude based on real, geometry
-driven ground-station access, and a thermal sensor/reaction-wheel
motor-thermal model layered onto a full ADCS hardware suite.
See that directory's own `README.md` for the full catalog and
what each one teaches -- every file also carries its own extensive
`description` field (visible in the GUI's scenario form, or by opening
the `.json` directly) explaining what to look at after running it and
what to try changing.

They're built through `schema.scenario`'s own dataclasses and
`Scenario.validate()` (via `scripts/_generate_templates.py`, kept in the
repository as the regeneration source of truth), not hand-written JSON,
and every one is covered by `tests/test_scenario_templates.py`
(schema-level load/validate/round-trip, Basilisk-free),
`tests/gui/test_scenario_templates_gui.py` (confirms each one also
round-trips through the actual `ScenarioEditorWidget` form),
`tests/gui/test_load_scenario_widget.py` (the in-GUI picker described
below), and `tests/gui/test_template_wizard.py` (the "Customize:
\<template name\>..." wizard spec registry -- see "Running the GUI"
below) -- 216 tests total across those four files, all passing. What's
NOT yet verified: an actual Basilisk run of any of them (this sandbox has
none), so treat the physical numbers (propellant use, drift rates,
orbital periods) as reasonable back-of-the-envelope choices, not
independently confirmed results against a real Basilisk build for this
specific scenario file -- see "Verification status" above for what has
and hasn't been run for real.

**Built into the GUI itself** (not just files you'd have to know the path
to): the GUI's **Load Scenario** tab (`gui/load_scenario_widget.py`,
see "Running the GUI" above) lists all twenty by name with their
description shown on selection, no file-browsing needed -- "Open
Template" or a double-click loads one and switches straight to the
Scenario Editor tab. The same tab's "Browse for a file..." button covers
everything else, via the same `MainWindow.open_path()` File > Open
already uses. From the CLI:

```bash
spacemissionstudio validate spacemissionstudio/scenarios/templates/01_two_body_circular_orbit.json  # no Basilisk needed
spacemissionstudio run spacemissionstudio/scenarios/templates/01_two_body_circular_orbit.json --out-dir out
```

To use one as a starting point for your own mission: **Save As...** under
a new name before editing (so the original template stays intact for
next time), then layer in whatever additional concepts you need --
templates/README.md's own closing section has concrete suggestions for
combining them (e.g. a comms-relay constellation might start from '04'
and add '07''s ADCS hardware plus a ground station and RF link).

## Vendoring vs. building Basilisk from source

Building from source in an automated/CI/sandboxed context is fragile --
this project hit exactly that failure mode early on (see `HISTORY.md`
for the full story). The plan flagged from the start was to
**vendor a prebuilt wheel pinned to a specific Basilisk release/commit**
as the default install path for end users, keeping "build from source" a
documented, opt-in developer path only.

That plan turned out to be simpler to satisfy than expected: Basilisk
itself now publishes prebuilt wheels to PyPI (`pip install "bsk[all]"`),
so there is usually no separate wheel to hunt down or vendor at all --
"Getting started" above IS the vendoring story for most users.
`packaging/install.sh --basilisk-wheel` still exists and still works (it
was run end-to-end against `"bsk[all]"` for real -- see
`packaging/README.md`) for the cases that DO need something other than
the published PyPI package: a specific pinned/older release for
reproducibility, a locally-built wheel with custom modules, or an offline
install from a wheel file already on disk. `--basilisk-wheel` accepts any
string `pip install` would (a path, a URL, or a plain requirement
specifier like `"bsk[all]==2.12.0"`), not literally only a `.whl` file.

## Closed-off/offline policy

SpaceMissionStudio makes **no network calls implicitly**. Nothing here ever
fetches anything without asking first -- there are exactly three places
network access can happen, all opt-in:

* **Installation** -- `pip install "bsk[all]"` (an ordinary PyPI install
  step) and a one-time pre-fetch of SPICE/gravity-harmonics/magnetic-field
  support data (`engine.kernels.require_kernels()`, called by all four
  packaging installers right after installing SpaceMissionStudio itself)
  that warms Basilisk's own local `pooch`-backed cache for good -- see
  `packaging/README.md`'s "Closed-off/offline policy" section for exactly
  where in each script and why.
* **The startup fetch/update prompt** (`gui.startup_fetch_dialog`) -- a
  dialog shown once each time the GUI starts, asking whether to check for
  updates to support-data kernels and/or real space-weather history
  (CelesTrak) now, and cache the result locally for later use. **Always
  asks first** -- there is no "don't ask again" setting and nothing here
  is ever fetched silently; clicking **Skip**, or unchecking both items,
  touches no network at all, same as if the dialog didn't exist. A
  successful space-weather fetch is an ordinary local CSV afterward -- the
  Propagation Setup dialog's Local file field pre-fills with it
  automatically (`engine.spaceweather.cached_fetch_path()`) when the
  scenario doesn't already have its own `local_file_path` set.
* **Launch Vizard's "Download Vizard" button** (`gui.vizard_launcher
  .fetch_vizard`) -- reached only via an explicit click in the "Vizard not
  found" dialog (Run menu's **Launch Vizard**), never automatically;
  downloads AVS's own pre-built Vizard binary and caches it locally, same
  "ask first, store locally for next time" shape as the startup prompt.
  The original manual **Browse...** option (point this app at an existing
  Vizard install yourself, from `docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst`'s
  published links) is always available alongside it.

`engine.spaceweather.resolve()` itself -- the function actually called
while a scenario runs -- still never touches the network under any
circumstance: `source` is only ever `"local_file"` (a CSV you point it at,
whether fetched via the startup prompt or supplied some other way) or
`"synthetic"` (a locally-generated, solar-cycle-shaped profile, no file or
network needed). There is no `"celestrak"` source value -- `fetch()` is a
separate, explicitly-invoked utility that produces an ordinary local file,
not a new value `source` can take. The `activity_level="conservative"`
worst-case-percentile margin is `local_file`-only for the same reason; the
bundled templates that used to default to it (04, 05, 07, 08, 18) ship
`nominal`/`synthetic` instead, with their own `description` explaining how
to restore the real-historical-data margin (fetch it via the startup
prompt, or supply your own local CSV).

## Known limitations

* **No `svIntegratorRK4` in this checkout.** Only `svIntegratorEuler`,
  `svIntegratorRK2`, `svIntegratorRKF45`, `svIntegratorRKF78` exist (see
  `../src/simulation/dynamics/Integrators/`). `schema.scenario.SimSettings`
  and `engine.service._INTEGRATORS` only offer those four; `"rkf78"` is
  the default.
* **Spherical-harmonics gravity is Earth-only in `service.py`**
  (GGM03S, the same file `../missionAnalysis` uses). Other central bodies
  are limited to point-mass gravity (`central_body_degree=0`) until a
  later phase adds their gravity-field files.
* **Magnetometer sensors are Earth-only** (`magneticFieldWMM`, same
  reasoning as spherical-harmonics gravity) -- `engine.fsw` raises a clear
  error for a magnetometer on any other central body rather than silently
  producing a sensor with no field to read.
* **Both actuator kinds beyond `"reaction_wheel"` are wired up, each for
  a specific role**: `"thruster"` either as primary attitude control
  (real `thrusterDynamicEffector` + `thrForceMapping` + `thrFiringSchmitt`
  -- a spacecraft uses `"reaction_wheel"` OR `"thruster"` for control, not
  both) or, together with `"reaction_wheel"`, as `MomentumDumpingConfig`'s
  desaturation hardware; `"magnetic_torque_rod"` ONLY as
  `MagneticMomentumManagementConfig`'s desaturation hardware (continuous
  RW momentum biasing via the real geomagnetic field, not a discrete
  burst) -- there is no standalone magnetic-torque-rod attitude-control/
  detumble mode, so a `"magnetic_torque_rod"` actuator without
  `magnetic_momentum_management` set is rejected early with a specific
  error.
* **The attitude control loop closes on truth spacecraft state**, EXCEPT
  for sun heading specifically. `simpleNav` is in the loop (not raw
  `scStateOutMsg`), but its error-model matrices are left at Basilisk's
  own zero defaults -- there is no GUI/schema field yet to configure
  realistic navigation error. `fsw_mode: sunSafePoint`'s
  `fsw_params['use_css_estimation']` is the one exception: it drives the
  controller from a real `cssWlsEst` weighted-least-squares estimate
  computed from a dedicated `coarse_sun_sensor` cluster, not truth (see
  `14_css_sun_heading_estimation.json`). A full attitude DETERMINATION
  filter (star tracker + rate gyro + reaction-wheel speeds through
  Basilisk's `inertialUKF`) is deliberately not built -- no clean shipped
  Basilisk example was found to verify one against safely.
* **`engine.fsw.DEFAULT_MRP_GAINS` (`K=3.5`, `P=30.0`), lifted directly
  from Basilisk's own `examples/BskSim` reference, is tuned for a
  900 kg*m^2 spacecraft** running its FSW task at a 0.1s rate -- applied
  unscaled to a much smaller spacecraft (this schema's own default
  inertia is 10 kg*m^2), the resulting discrete-time control update
  reliably diverges to NaN within seconds. **No longer a trap for a new
  spacecraft**: `engine.fsw.build_mrp_feedback` now auto-scales K/P by
  that spacecraft's own `inertia_kg_m2` relative to the 900 kg*m^2
  reference (`_default_mrp_gains_for_inertia`) whenever
  `SpacecraftConfig.control_params` doesn't explicitly set `K`/`P` --
  confirmed against a real Basilisk build to converge cleanly even at the
  schema's own coarse `dynamics_task_rate_s` default, where the unscaled
  reference gains diverge (`tests/test_default_mrp_gain_scaling.py`).
  This was previously applied only by hand, to specific templates
  (`07_attitude_pointing_with_adcs_hardware.json`,
  `14_css_sun_heading_estimation.json`'s explicit scaled
  `control_params`; `06_attitude_pointing_basic.json`'s finer task rate)
  before it was generalized into `engine.fsw` itself for every
  spacecraft -- those templates' own explicit choices are now redundant
  but harmless. Passing explicit `control_params={"K": ..., "P": ...}`
  still overrides this unscaled, same as always -- that choice stays on
  you.
* **Monte Carlo dispersions cover two quantities**: `dry_mass_kg`
  (uniform/normal) and `attitude_sigma_bn` (uniform-random-attitude).
  Cartesian position/velocity dispersion is deliberately NOT offered --
  see `engine/monte_carlo.py`'s module docstring for why (Basilisk's
  Cartesian dispersion classes replace each component with an absolute
  random value, not a perturbation around the nominal orbit).
* **`monte_carlo.thread_count > 1` is unverified** in this project's
  development sandbox (no Basilisk build here to run it against) -- the
  schema default is the definitely-safe `1`.
* **Monte Carlo retains a fixed set of data per run** (each spacecraft's
  position/velocity) -- there is no per-run custom retention-policy
  selection in the schema yet.
* **No Jacchia-Roberts atmosphere model, no Earth-albedo/IR radiation
  pressure, no `TabularAtmosphere` (user-supplied density table).** All
  three were real user questions/requests, checked directly against
  Basilisk's own source (not assumed) before answering:
  * Jacchia-Roberts genuinely doesn't exist anywhere in Basilisk (checked
    `src/simulation/environment/` -- only `ExponentialAtmosphere`,
    `MsisAtmosphere`, `TabularAtmosphere` do); `atmosphere_model` offers
    the first two (see "Orbital dynamics & propagation" above), not the
    one that doesn't exist.
  * Basilisk's `earthRadiationModel` module computes Earth albedo/IR
    flux, but its own payload comment names `facetERPDynamicEffector` as
    the consumer that turns that flux into an actual orbital force --
    and that module doesn't exist in this Basilisk build either (checked
    the source tree and the installed package). Wiring this up for real
    would mean writing a brand-new, never-before-exercised force
    -effector from scratch (the same `extForceTorque` manual-force
    -injection pattern this project's own thrust controllers use, plus
    the standard flux/c * area * Cr formula solar SRP already uses) --
    deliberately not done this round; real user decision, not a gap that
    slipped through unnoticed.
  * `TabularAtmosphere` (a user-supplied altitude/density CSV) would need
    a new file-upload schema/GUI concept of its own -- out of scope for
    the atmosphere-model-choice work that added `ExponentialAtmosphere`
    as the second option.
* **This development sandbox itself still can't reach the NAIF SPICE
  kernel host** (its network policy blocks it), so `engine.kernels`'s
  download step always fails here specifically -- correctly, with a
  clear error, not a code defect. This is a sandbox limitation, not a
  project limitation: a real user's machine, with ordinary internet
  access, has since run full multi-day simulations successfully (see
  "Verification status" above) -- kept in this list only because it's
  still true of THIS development sandbox specifically.

## Version 2.0.0

A **MAJOR** version bump under semver -- the only breaking change in
this project's history so far, and the reason it's 2.0.0 and not 1.1.1:
every scenario file, template, and simulation capability from 1.1.0
carries over completely unchanged (see "Version 1.1.0" below for all of
that); what breaks is anyone's own code that imports the old package
name or invokes the old CLI command.

* **Renamed from "missionStudio" to "SpaceMissionStudio"** (short form
  "SMS" -- in prose only, never the CLI command or package name, since
  that would collide confusingly with Short Message Service), requested
  directly. A full technical rename, not just branding:
  * Directory: `missionStudio/` -> `SpaceMissionStudio/`.
  * Python package/import name: `missionstudio` -> `spacemissionstudio`.
    **Migration**: change `import missionstudio` / `from missionstudio
    import ...` to `import spacemissionstudio` / `from
    spacemissionstudio import ...` anywhere you've scripted against this
    project.
  * CLI command: `missionstudio ...` -> `spacemissionstudio ...`
    (`pyproject.toml`'s `[project.scripts]` entry point).
  * PyPI/`.deb` package name: `missionstudio` -> `spacemissionstudio`.
  * Windows installer: app name/publisher/install directory/Start Menu
    group/output filename all updated, plus a freshly-regenerated
    `AppId` GUID (the field's own comment says not to reuse a GUID for a
    different application identity, and this is one -- no end user has
    ever installed the old build via this installer, which has still
    never been run on a real Windows machine).
  * Desktop entry (`packaging/spacemissionstudio.desktop.in` and the
    packaged `.desktop`): `Name=`/`Exec=`/`Icon=`/`StartupWMClass=` all
    updated, files themselves renamed.
  * Every in-app GUI string (window title, About dialog, Load Scenario
    tab text, ...) -- confirmed with a real headless render, not just
    grep.
  * All 120 files referencing the old name in any case form
    (`missionstudio`, `missionStudio`, `Missionstudio`,
    `MISSIONSTUDIO` -- all four variants genuinely appeared somewhere,
    including a PowerShell PascalCase parameter name and an
    env-var-style all-caps pair in a template's own description field)
    updated consistently.
  * Deliberately NOT touched: `HISTORY.md`'s development log keeps
    saying "missionStudio"/"missionstudio" throughout, since it's an
    honest record of what was actually true when each entry was written
    -- the same "nothing below was deleted or altered" discipline that
    file already states about itself. One note near the top explains
    the rename instead of rewriting history.
* **Removed `missionAnalysis`**, a standalone, one-off constellation
  mission-design case study that predates this project and was never
  run end-to-end in this development sandbox (its own README said so).
  Not imported or depended on anywhere -- the only references elsewhere
  were prose provenance comments ("ported directly from
  `../missionAnalysis`'s X"), left as historical design-rationale notes,
  not functional dependencies. This project has since absorbed and
  generalized essentially everything it did (constellation generation,
  station-keeping/phasing controllers, power budget, link-margin
  estimate, Vizard comm-ring visualization) with far more capability
  than the one fixed case study ever covered.
* **Version bumped** `1.1.0` -> `2.0.0` in `pyproject.toml`,
  `spacemissionstudio/__init__.py`, and
  `packaging/windows/spacemissionstudio.iss`'s `MyAppVersion` (the
  `.deb` reads `spacemissionstudio.__version__` directly, no change
  needed there). No scenario schema version bump -- `
  CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` is still `1`, every scenario file valid under
  1.1.0 is still valid, unmodified, under 2.0.0; the breaking surface is
  entirely the package/CLI identity above, not the scenario format.

## Version 1.1.0

A feature release on top of 1.0.0 -- new simulation capabilities, nine
more templates, and a GUI stability pass, all backward-compatible (no
scenario schema migration needed: every new field is purely additive,
see `schema/migrations.py`'s own docstring for that rule). What changed:

* **Four new actuator/effector capabilities, each with its own template**
  to learn from: real gravity-gradient disturbance torque
  (`enable_gravity_gradient` -> Basilisk's own `GravityGradientEffector`,
  `10_gravity_gradient_torque.json`); real thruster-actuated attitude
  control (`thrusterDynamicEffector` + `thrForceMapping` +
  `thrFiringSchmitt`, `11_thruster_attitude_control.json`); reaction
  -wheel momentum desaturation via a thruster cluster
  (`MomentumDumpingConfig`, `12_reaction_wheel_momentum_dumping.json`)
  and, as an alternative, via magnetic torque rods
  (`MagneticMomentumManagementConfig`,
  `13_magnetic_torque_rod_momentum_management.json`); and real propellant
  depletion through Basilisk's own `fuelTank` state effector, tied to a
  thruster's own mass-flow rate (`FuelTankConfig`,
  `17_fuel_tank_depletion.json`).
* **Two new attitude-guidance capabilities**: real CSS-based sun-heading
  ESTIMATION (not truth) feeding `sunSafePoint` via a `cssWlsEst`
  weighted-least-squares estimator (`14_css_sun_heading_estimation.json`),
  and direct celestial-body pointing -- `locationPointing` aimed at a
  body other than a ground station, via `build_ephemeris_converter`
  (`15_celestial_body_pointing.json`).
* **A new Mission Sequence command**: `lambert_transfer` solves for
  whatever delta-V takes a spacecraft to a target position after a given
  time of flight (rather than specifying the delta-V directly), via
  Basilisk's own `lambertPlanner` -> `lambertSolver` -> `lambertValidator`
  chain (`16_lambert_transfer.json`).
* **A direct LEO counterpart to GEO station-keeping**:
  `18_leo_station_keeping.json` -- drag-driven decay instead of GEO's
  Sun/Moon/SRP drift, same `station_keeping` controller. Eighteen
  built-in templates total now, up from the nine 1.0.0 shipped with.
* **The "Customize: \<template name\>..." guided wizard, rolled out to
  all eighteen templates** (`gui/template_wizard.py`, piloted on three in
  an earlier round) -- a short, multi-step walkthrough over just one
  template's own key tunable parameters, pre-filled with its current
  values, for anyone who wants "this template, but with X changed"
  without learning the full Scenario Editor form.
* **A real, previously-silent attitude-control instability closed by
  default.** `engine.fsw.DEFAULT_MRP_GAINS` (tuned for a 900 kg*m^2
  reference spacecraft) reliably diverges to NaN when applied unscaled to
  a much smaller one -- previously fixed by hand, per template, wherever
  it was noticed. `engine.fsw.build_mrp_feedback` now auto-scales K/P by
  a spacecraft's own inertia by default, closing this for every new
  spacecraft, not just the templates someone remembered to fix (see
  "Known limitations" below and `tests/test_default_mrp_gain_scaling.py`).
* **A GUI stability pass**, prompted by real user reports of windows that
  "don't allow maximizing" and visual corruption on resize: audited every
  `QDialog`/`QWizard` in `gui/` for the same root cause (a widget's
  `sizeHint()` not reflecting its real content, confirmed from real
  user screenshots -- the offscreen Qt platform plugin used for automated
  testing could not reproduce any of these), fixing `SpacecraftEditorDialog`
  and every `TemplateCustomizeWizard` spec's sizing, and wrapping
  `LoadScenarioWidget`'s content in its own `QScrollArea` after a real
  screenshot showed overlapping, garbled text in its Load Scenario tab on
  resize/maximize.
* **A beginner-friendly user manual** ([`USER_MANUAL.md`](USER_MANUAL.md)),
  illustrated with real screenshots of the running app, plus a README
  accuracy pass (the repository layout tree, test counts, and template
  catalog had drifted behind the real codebase; one factually-reversed
  "Known limitations" claim about MRP gain scaling was corrected).
* **Version bumped** `1.0.0` -> `1.1.0` in `pyproject.toml`,
  `spacemissionstudio/__init__.py`, and both installers' version strings
  (`packaging/windows/spacemissionstudio.iss`'s `MyAppVersion`; the `.deb`
  reads `spacemissionstudio.__version__` directly, so it needed no change).
  No schema version bump and no breaking changes -- every scenario file
  valid under 1.0.0 is still valid, unmodified, under 1.1.0.

## Version 1.0.0

The first tagged release. What changed for it, and what "1.0.0" actually
means here:

* **A real end-to-end run, on a real Basilisk install, finally happened**
  -- the one specific gap this project had flagged since Phase 0 (this
  development sandbox's network policy blocks the NAIF SPICE kernel
  host, so a full run past kernel loading was never independently
  confirmed here). A real user ran the full `05_formation_flying_phasing.json`
  template -- both `StationKeepingController` and `PhasingKeepingController`
  active, Vizard live-streaming on -- to 100% completion (`t=604800.0 s`
  of `604800.0 s`, the full 7 simulated days) with no errors. Getting
  there involved finding and fixing a real, previously-unreproducible
  crash along the way -- a long investigation that initially misidentified
  eclipse-handling as the cause before a real `gdb` session traced it to
  a dangling-pointer bug in `engine/vizard.py`'s Vizard live-data panels
  (see "Verification status" above, and `HISTORY.md` for the full
  investigation).
* **Cross-platform install.** `python -m venv` + `pip install "bsk[all]"`
  + `pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"` (the "Getting started" section above)
  works identically on Linux and Windows 11 -- Basilisk's own prebuilt
  wheels are published for both (`../docs/source/Install.rst`'s "Prebuilt
  wheel availability" table), and SpaceMissionStudio's own code was already
  written with per-OS awareness where it matters (`gui/vizard_launcher.py`'s
  `_candidate_roots()`/`_EXECUTABLE_NAME` branch on `sys.platform` for
  finding the external Vizard app; `Path.home()`, never a raw `$HOME`/
  POSIX assumption, for every user-data location). `packaging/install.ps1`/
  `build_wheel.ps1` are new this release -- direct PowerShell ports of
  the already-verified `install.sh`/`build_wheel.sh`, giving Windows the
  same one-command install + Start Menu shortcut experience Linux has had
  since Phase 3. Per this project's own verification discipline: the
  Linux install scripts and the Linux Basilisk-wheel install have been
  run for real; their Windows counterparts have not (no Windows
  environment has ever been available in this development sandbox) --
  see `packaging/README.md`'s "Windows support" section for exactly
  what that does and doesn't cover, and please report anything that
  doesn't work as documented on a real Windows 11 machine.
* **Version bumped** `0.1.0.dev0` -> `1.0.0` in `pyproject.toml` and
  `spacemissionstudio/__init__.py`.

## What's next

Scoped but not yet built, from real GUI usage feedback (full detail in
`HISTORY.md`'s "What Phase 4 adds" and "What Phase 5 adds"):

* **`engine.constellation`'s Walker generator doesn't auto-wire
  `PhasingKeepingConfig`** for the satellites it produces -- each
  follower's chief/target-separation still needs setting up by hand in
  the spacecraft editor afterward. A natural, well-scoped follow-on once
  that manual step is felt to be tedious in practice: the generator
  already knows each plane's membership and phase ordering, so it could
  assign chief = "first satellite in the plane" and a sensible default
  target separation automatically.
* **A live NUMERIC link-margin gauge in Vizard** -- still deliberately
  not built: Vizard's `GenericStorage` only accepts Battery/DataStorage/
  FuelTank-shaped messages, and forcing a dB margin value (which can be
  legitimately negative) through would need a fabricated adapter message
  with no natural floor/ceiling -- the same bug class the RTN separation
  panels already hit once and had fixed (see `HISTORY.md`). What WAS
  built instead, per direct user feedback that the Mission Dashboard's
  live telemetry "shall also be in the vizard live visualization, not
  only in the GUI itself": a colored "Link status" `GenericSensor` badge
  (link OK vs. no/degraded link, computed live from the exact same
  `engine.link_budget.link_margin_db` the GUI uses), plus "Mode" and
  "Pointing Error" panels for the rest of that same dashboard -- see
  `engine.vizard`'s own "Live-data panels" docstring section. The exact
  dB breakdown still only appears in the GUI's dashboard; if a live
  NUMBER (not just a status) is wanted in Vizard too, the right path
  remains a real custom Vizard protobuf message/panel type, not a reused
  `GenericStorage` shape.

Beyond that, the "Known limitations" section above is the rest of the
honest map: non-Earth spherical harmonics/magnetometer, navigation
error modeling, and richer Monte Carlo retention. None of the
remaining items is blocked on a design decision; each is scoped and
documented at its own call site (or in `HISTORY.md`) for whoever picks
it up next.
