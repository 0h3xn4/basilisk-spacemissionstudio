"""Shared pytest fixtures/markers for the SpaceMissionStudio test suite.

Two independent "is this optional dependency installed" markers, both
auto-skipping (not failing collection, not silently passing) rather than
erroring the whole run when the corresponding install extra is missing:

* ``requires_basilisk``: needs a built Basilisk Python package. This
  development sandbox doesn't have one (see ``SpaceMissionStudio/README.md`` --
  a from-source build was attempted and failed because this sandbox's
  network policy blocks Conan Center).
* ``requires_gui``: needs PySide6 (the ``gui`` extra, ``pip install
  -e ".[gui]"``). Also forces ``QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`` before any Qt
  import happens (unless the environment already set ``QT_QPA_PLATFORM``
  explicitly) so the GUI test suite runs on a machine with no display --
  this is how it is genuinely exercised in this development sandbox too,
  not just designed to work that way in theory.

    configure_logging()`` for real -- and several tests (``test_cli.py``
    in particular) call ``cli.main()`` directly, not through a subprocess,
    so without this, the FIRST such test in the whole session would
    permanently mutate this test process's real root logger (adding a
    ``StreamHandler`` bound to whatever ``sys.stderr`` happened to be at
    that moment -- pytest's own per-test capture replaces ``sys.stderr``
    with a fresh object every test and closes the old one, so that
    handler would start raising "I/O operation on closed file" on every
    later test that logs anything) and would write real log files into
    this machine's actual ``~/.spacemissionstudio/logs``, neither of which any
    test should do as a side effect of something unrelated.

    Autouse (applies to literally every test, not just ``test_logging_
    setup.py``'s own) since the leak this prevents is caused by ANY test
    that happens to invoke a real entry point, not just tests that are
    themselves about logging.
