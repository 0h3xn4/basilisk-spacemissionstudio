"""Tests for engine.vizard._rtn_panel_label/_usable_label_width_px -- plain
functions, no Basilisk import needed (engine.vizard's own Basilisk imports
are all lazy, inside enable_vizard() -- see that module's docstring), so
this runs even in this development sandbox without a Basilisk build,
unlike tests/test_vizard.py (marked requires_basilisk).

Regression coverage for two real user reports on the RTN separation
panels (see engine.vizard's own docstring, "Real bug found from a real
running Vizard screenshot, FOURTH round"): the panels didn't say WHOSE
offset they showed, fixed by folding the chief's name into the label; and
Vizard truncates a panel row's own label -- but at a width that SCALES
with the follower spacecraft's own name (see _usable_label_width_px's own
docstring, reverse-engineered directly from 0h3xn4/vizard's Unity
source), not a flat per-row constant as an earlier revision of this fix
assumed. A chief name (or even the short generic fallback) long enough to
risk exceeding that scenario's own budget must fall back further rather
than risk being cut off mid-word.
