"""Regression test for a codebase-audit finding: ``engine.orbit_maintenance``'s
:class:`~spacemissionstudio.engine.orbit_maintenance.StationKeepingController`
(and ``PhasingKeepingController``/``ConstantFrameThrustController``, which
share the identical pattern) used to compute its achieved-acceleration/
delta-V estimate as ``thrustMag / scObject.hub.mHub`` -- which undercounts
the spacecraft's TRUE total mass whenever a
``schema.scenario.FuelTankConfig`` "fuel_tank" state effector is ALSO
configured on the same spacecraft (e.g. for an unrelated thruster
actuator's own attitude-control or momentum-dumping propellant). Confirmed
directly in Basilisk's ``fuelTank.cpp``: that effector tracks its own mass
via ``effProps.mEff``, contributing correctly to the spacecraft's REAL
simulated dynamics, but never touching ``hub.mHub`` at all -- so reading
only ``hub.mHub`` here silently misses it, inflating the controller's own
acceleration/delta-V estimate and ending a burn early (an achieved-delta-V
undershoot), purely in this controller's own bookkeeping (the real
simulated dynamics were always physically correct, since Basilisk's own
integrator sums every state effector's mass correctly regardless of what
this controller reads).

The fix (see ``engine.orbit_maintenance``'s module docstring, "Shared mass
bookkeeping" section): the acceleration/delta-V estimate now reads
``scObject.scMassOutMsg.read().massSC`` -- Basilisk's own hub+state
-effector mass aggregate -- while the propellant-burn write-back
(``hub.mHub = ...``) deliberately keeps reading/writing ``hub.mHub``
specifically (using the aggregate there would double-count the fuel
tank's own mass).

This builds a real, running ``SimBaseClass`` (spacecraft + a real
``fuelTank`` state effector + ``StationKeepingController`` via
:func:`build_station_keeping`) below the station-keeping deadband (so the
controller burns immediately) and confirms the controller's own
``_cumulativeDv`` after one tick matches ``thrust / (hub_mass +
tank_mass)``, not the smaller (buggy) ``thrust / hub_mass`` alone.

Requires a Basilisk build (marked ``requires_basilisk``; see
tests/conftest.py).
