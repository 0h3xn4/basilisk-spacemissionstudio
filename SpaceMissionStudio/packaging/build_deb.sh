# Builds a real, installable Debian package (spacemissionstudio_<version>_all.deb):
# a genuine "apt install ./spacemissionstudio_*.deb" / double-click-in-a-file
# -manager experience -- no terminal, no pip commands typed by the end
# user. The package itself only carries SpaceMissionStudio's own pure-Python
# wheel (built via build_wheel.sh) plus a handful of maintainer scripts
# (packaging/deb/DEBIAN/) and a desktop entry; Basilisk itself is NOT
# bundled (~impractical to vendor a multi-hundred-MB compiled wheel with
# mujoco/rust bits into a package built in this project's own development
# sandbox -- see packaging/README.md's "The vendoring decision") --
# instead, postinst creates a dedicated virtualenv at /opt/spacemissionstudio/venv
# and pip installs "bsk[all]" from PyPI there the moment the package is
# configured (dpkg/apt's normal "configure" step), which needs internet
# access on the installing machine, same tradeoff install.sh's own
# --basilisk-wheel-less path already has.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build_deb.sh [OUTPUT_DIR]
#
# Genuinely built AND test-installed (via `dpkg -i` as root, in a
# throwaway environment with real network access to PyPI) in this
# project's own development sandbox -- see packaging/README.md for what
# exactly that confirmed.
