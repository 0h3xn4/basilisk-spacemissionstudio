# End-user Linux installer: creates a private virtualenv, installs
# spacemissionstudio (+ the 'gui' extra) into it, installs a vendored Basilisk
# wheel into the SAME venv if one is given, and drops a launcher script.
#
# This is the "vendor a prebuilt wheel pinned to a specific Basilisk
# release/commit" default install path flagged in SpaceMissionStudio/README.md
# since Phase 0. It has been run and verified for the spacemissionstudio-only
# path in this project's development sandbox (build a wheel with
# build_wheel.sh, run this script against it, launch `spacemissionstudio
# validate` from the installed venv); the Basilisk-wheel path is written
# against pip's ordinary wheel-install behavior (nothing spacemissionstudio
# -specific) but could NOT be verified end-to-end here, because this
# sandbox has no built Basilisk wheel to test against (see the main
# README's "Environment honesty note" -- the same Conan Center network
# block that stopped a from-source Basilisk build also means there is no
# vendorable wheel sitting around here to test this script's other path
# with). See this directory's README.md for the full picture.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh [--prefix DIR] [--basilisk-wheel PATH_OR_URL] [--spacemissionstudio-wheel PATH] [--no-desktop-entry]
#
#   --prefix DIR               Where to create the venv (default: ~/.local/share/spacemissionstudio)
#   --basilisk-wheel PATH      Path or URL to a prebuilt Basilisk wheel to vendor into the venv.
#                               Omit this and the script installs spacemissionstudio only, with a
#                               clear note that Run/Check Kernels/Monte Carlo won't work until
#                               a Basilisk build is added to the venv some other way.
#   --spacemissionstudio-wheel PATH Install this local wheel instead of building/fetching one
#                               (defaults to running build_wheel.sh next to this script).
#   --no-desktop-entry          Skip installing a ~/.local/share/applications/*.desktop entry.
