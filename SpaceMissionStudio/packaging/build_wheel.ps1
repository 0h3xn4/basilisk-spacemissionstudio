.SYNOPSIS
    Builds spacemissionstudio's own wheel + sdist -- the Basilisk-independent
    part of packaging. Windows/PowerShell counterpart of build_wheel.sh;
    see that script's own header comment for the two real bugs already
    found and fixed on the Linux side, both of which apply here unchanged
    since they're about setuptools/`python -m build`, not the shell:

      1. spacemissionstudio/scenarios/*.json (data with no __init__.py) needs
         pyproject.toml's [tool.setuptools.package-data] entry, or it's
         silently missing from the built wheel.
      2. `python -m build`'s own temp ./build/ output directory (gitignored)
         shadows the installed `build` package on the next Python process
         if left behind (`python` inserts the current directory at the
         front of sys.path for both `-c` and `-m`) -- this script cleans
         it first, same as build_wheel.sh.

    NOT independently run against a real Windows machine in this project's
    development sandbox (Linux-only, no Windows environment available
    here) -- written against documented, standard `python -m build`/pip
    behavior and this same logic already verified on the Linux side, but
    flagged here rather than claimed as verified. Please report any
    issues building on a real Windows 11 machine.
