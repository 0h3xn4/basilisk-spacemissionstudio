# Builds spacemissionstudio's own wheel + sdist -- the Basilisk-independent part
# of packaging. This has been run for real in this project's development
# sandbox (no Basilisk build there, but none is needed for this step):
#
#     python3 -m pip install build
#     ./packaging/build_wheel.sh
#     # -> dist/spacemissionstudio-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
#     # -> dist/spacemissionstudio-<version>.tar.gz
#
# A real bug was caught doing this the first time: spacemissionstudio/scenarios/
# *.json (the two-body validation scenario) was silently missing from the
# built wheel, because setuptools' packages.find() only picks up Python
# packages (dirs with __init__.py) and scenarios/ has none. Fixed in
# pyproject.toml's [tool.setuptools.package-data] -- see that file's own
# comment. Verified by actually building the wheel, installing it into a
# throwaway venv, and running `spacemissionstudio validate` against the
# installed copy of that file; do the same after any packaging change here.
#
# This script does NOT bundle Basilisk -- see install.sh and this
# directory's README.md for why (this project does not have a Basilisk
# wheel to vendor in this development sandbox; a real release build must
# supply one).

# setuptools' own build backend writes its temp output to ./build (gitignored,

# genuinely breaks the NEXT run: both `python3 -c "import ..."` and
# `python3 -m ...` insert the current directory at the front of sys.path,
# so a leftover ./build/ directory silently SHADOWS the real installed
# `build` package (it has no __main__.py, so `python3 -m build` then fails
# with "No module named build.__main__"). Caught by actually re-running this
# script twice in a row in this project's development sandbox, not a
# hypothetical -- always start from a clean slate here.
