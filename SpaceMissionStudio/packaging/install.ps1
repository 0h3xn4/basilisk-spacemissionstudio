.SYNOPSIS
    End-user Windows installer: creates a private virtualenv, installs
    spacemissionstudio (+ the 'gui' extra) into it, installs a vendored
    Basilisk wheel into the SAME venv if one is given, and drops a
    launcher + Start Menu shortcut.

    Windows/PowerShell counterpart of install.sh -- see that script's own
    header comment for the full design rationale (the "vendor a prebuilt
    Basilisk wheel pinned to a specific release/commit" install path, and
    why the spacemissionstudio-only path is fully supported/tested while the
    +Basilisk-wheel path is ordinary, non-spacemissionstudio-specific `pip`
    behavior). Most users on either platform can also just follow the
    main README's "Getting started" section directly (`python -m venv`,
    `pip install "bsk[all]"`, `pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"`) -- this
    script exists for a one-command install of a BUILT wheel, matching
    install.sh's role on Linux.

    NOT independently run against a real Windows 11 machine in this
    project's development sandbox (Linux-only, no Windows environment
    available here) -- written against documented, standard PowerShell/
    venv/pip/WScript.Shell behavior and install.sh's own already-verified
    logic (same structure, same flags, same fallback messages), but
    flagged here rather than claimed as verified end-to-end. Please
    report any issues running this on a real Windows 11 machine.

.PARAMETER Prefix
    Where to create the venv. Default: $env:LOCALAPPDATA\spacemissionstudio

.PARAMETER BasiliskWheel
    Path or URL to a prebuilt Basilisk wheel to vendor into the venv.
    Omit this and the script installs spacemissionstudio only, with a clear
    note that Run/Check Kernels/Monte Carlo won't work until a Basilisk
    build is added to the venv some other way.

.PARAMETER SpaceMissionStudioWheel
    Install this local wheel instead of building/fetching one (defaults
    to running build_wheel.ps1 next to this script).

.PARAMETER NoShortcut
    Skip creating a Start Menu shortcut.

.EXAMPLE
    .\install.ps1 -BasiliskWheel "bsk[all]==2.12.0"

.EXAMPLE
    .\install.ps1 -Prefix "C:\Tools\spacemissionstudio" -NoShortcut
